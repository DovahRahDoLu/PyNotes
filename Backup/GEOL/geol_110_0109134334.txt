--[Earth origins and structure]--
   [Big Bang Theory]
      15 Billion Years ago
      Exploded into existance
      Fundamental particles that make up everything we
        know to exist were created
      Observationall evidence for the big bang
        includes:
         hubble's observations on motion of galaxies
         observation of uniform cosmic background
           radiation
         some consistency arguments on the time it
           takes to form the observed galaxy clusters and
           atomic elements
      temperature of empty space is 2.7k (kelvin)
         nearly absolute zero
      300,000 years:
         hydrogen and helium nuclei form
      1 billion years
         protogalaxies form
      So universe only had hydrogen and helium
         within stars, solar fusion occurs and creates
           the other 90 naturally occurring elements
           created in stars
         Star is a nuclear furnace
      within stars, high temperatures allow fusion
        beginning with hydrogen and continuing through
        iron
         stars can make up to iron
   [Supernovas and heavier elements]
      remaining elements require much energy to form,
        energy is found in supernovae explosions
      Elements heavier than iron form in thefew secons
        ofa large stellar explosion and subsequently less
        abundant

   [Our Solar System]
      Formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when a gas
        cloud produced from the big bang and a prior
        supernovae coalesced
      The proto-sun was concentrated at the center of
        the disc, and perhaps rings formed much like
        those around saturn
         these rings would become planets
      the gravitational collapse ignighted fusion began
        in the sun
      Early sun had a powerful solar wind that began to
        blow much of the light elements away from the
        inner parts of the disk
      Fundamental reason for the rocky inner planets
        and gaseous outer planets in our solar system. in
        the meantime, planets formed by the gaggregation
        of the nebular material material remaining in the
        disckk
   [Early Earth Formation]
      Dust and ice particals form in the disks collide
        and form progressively larger planetesimals
      larger planetesimals collide to form proto
        oearth, which is heated from the violent tature
        of collisions
      gravity reshapes earth into a sphere, the hot
        inner liquid core differentiates from a semi-
        molten mantle

      [Two hypotheses of earth accretion]
         heterogeneous
            iron core forms before lighter materials
         Homogeneous
            everything groups together, then splits up

      Soon after the earth forms, it is impacted with a
        mars-sized planet or meteorite
         impact forms ring of dust around earth
   [The moon]
      The udst and debris from the impact eventually
        eggregate to form a large singular mass
      due to conserved angular momentum during impact,
        the earth and moon rotate on a 1:1 ratio
      Same side always faces earth
   [Meanwhile]
      the earth continues to develop
         more dense material moves toward center
         Due to extremely high pressure at earth
           center, a solid core of iron and nickel
           develops
      Much volcanic activit results in 2 things
         less dense material (silica, oxygen, carbon,
           hydrogen, moved to surface
            some in solid form: magma, lava
            some in gaseous: water vapor, carbon
              dioxide, methane
   [The Earth's atmosphere]
      early atmosphere had no o2 gas
         all o2 derived from photosynthesis
         evidense from banded iron formations
      Mostly contains n2 and o2
         78% n2
         21% o2
   [Surface]
      most solid material on surface
         oxygen
      much of earths crust lies below sea level
      Highest point on earth vs lowest point
         8.8km highest
         10.9km lowest
         19774 meters between highest and lowest points
   [Earths interior]
      3.3km is deepest mine
      1741m is deepest drilling point
      kimberlite deposits
      diamonds
      these are volcanic
      everything else we know about the materials below
        the crust comed fromm seismic waves
         earthquakes
      derived from wave velocity discontinues
   [Earth Construction]
      continental crust
      sea level
      Upper Mantle
      Lower mantle
         solidish
      outer core
         liquid
      inner core
         solid
