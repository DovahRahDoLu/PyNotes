--[Earth origins and structure]--
   [Big Bang Theory]
      15 Billion Years ago
      Exploded into existance
      Fundamental particles that make up everything we
        know to exist were created
      Observationall evidence for the big bang
        includes:
         hubble's observations on motion of galaxies
         observation of uniform cosmic background
           radiation
         some consistency arguments on the time it
           takes to form the observed galaxy clusters and
           atomic elements
      temperature of empty space is 2.7k (kelvin)
         nearly absolute zero
      300,000 years:
         hydrogen and helium nuclei form
      1 billion years
         protogalaxies form
      So universe only had hydrogen and helium
         within stars, solar fusion occurs and creates
           the other 90 naturally occurring elements
           created in stars
         Star is a nuclear furnace
      within stars, high temperatures allow fusion
        beginning with hydrogen and continuing through
        iron
         stars can make up to iron
   [Supernovas and heavier elements]
      remaining elements require much energy to form,
        energy is found in supernovae explosions
      Elements heavier than iron form in thefew secons
        ofa large stellar explosion and subsequently less
        abundant

   [Our Solar System]
      Formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when a gas
        cloud produced from the big bang and a prior
        supernovae coalesced
      The proto-sun was concentrated at the center of
        the disc, and perhaps rings formed much like
        those around saturn
         these rings would become planets
      the gravitational collapse ignighted fusion began
        in the sun
      Early sun had a powerful solar wind that began to
        blow much of the light elements away from the
        inner parts of the disk
      Fundamental reason for the rocky inner planets
        and gaseous outer planets in our solar system. in
        the meantime, planets formed by the gaggregation
        of the nebular material material remaining in the
        disckk
   [Early Earth Formation]
      Dust and ice particals form in the disks collide
        and form progressively larger planetesimals
      larger planetesimals collide to form proto
        oearth, which is heated from the violent tature
        of collisions
      gravity reshapes earth into a sphere, the hot
        inner liquid core differentiates from a semi-
        molten mantle

      [Two hypotheses of earth accretion]
         heterogeneous
            iron core forms before lighter materials
         Homogeneous
            everything groups together, then splits up

      Soon after the earth forms, it is impacted with a
        mars-sized planet or meteorite
         impact forms ring of dust around earth
   [The moon]
      The udst and debris from the impact eventually
        eggregate to form a large singular mass
      due to conserved angular momentum during impact,
        the earth and moon rotate on a 1:1 ratio
      Same side always faces earth
   [Meanwhile]
      the earth continues to develop
         more dense material moves toward center
         Due to extremely high pressure at earth
           center, a solid core of iron and nickel
           develops
      Much volcanic activit results in 2 things
         less dense material (silica, oxygen, carbon,
           hydrogen, moved to surface
            some in solid form: magma, lava
            some in gaseous: water vapor, carbon
              dioxide, methane
   [The Earth's atmosphere]
      early atmosphere had no o2 gas
         all o2 derived from photosynthesis
         evidense from banded iron formations
      Mostly contains n2 and o2
         78% n2
         21% o2
   [Surface]
      most solid material on surface
         oxygen
      much of earths crust lies below sea level
      Highest point on earth vs lowest point
         8.8km highest
         10.9km lowest
         19774 meters between highest and lowest points
   [Earths interior]
      3.3km is deepest mine
      1741m is deepest drilling point
      kimberlite deposits
      diamonds
      these are volcanic
      everything else we know about the materials below
        the crust comed fromm seismic waves
         earthquakes
      derived from wave velocity discontinues
   [Earth Construction]
      continental crust

      Upper Mantle
      Lower mantle
         solidish

--[Soils and Soil Formation]--
   Soils and Sediments are fundamentally different.
   soils support life
   [Soils vs Sediments]
      Sediments are particles of rocks that have been
        weathered either physically or chemically from
        their original state
         feldspar to clay
         sandstone to san
      sediments can form in situ (in place) relative to
        the source rock material or be transported long
        distances by wind or water

      Soils ALWAYS form in place. sediments are part of
        the soil
         sediment can be deposited in the soil and be
           incorporated
         soil that is eroded in some fasion is now
           sediment
      soil is Anisotropic and has the presence of
        Organic Material

      Organic matter
         dead things, mostly plants
      Anistropic
         organized change from one side to anotyher
           different from top to bottom - horizons

         R

         O
            Organic
            no influence from geology
            not affected much by parent material
            dark in color

            less clay than horizons below
            Zone of leeching
               like with coffee or tea
               dissolved what was in the tea and took
                 it out into the water
                  all of the tannins are leeched out of
                    the leaves
               ** Leaching
	E
            between a and b
            no organics
            very bright color
            white/light gray
            no clay
            zone of maximum leaching
         B
            almost all geology
            bright color

         C
            Weathered Bedrock
            only biology is around roots that cut
              through

         

      [Biology]
         Organism such as bacteria and fungi are the
           first organic contributors to soils
         over time, plants grow, insects and
           invertbrates follow, vertabrates follow them
           and all contribute their waste and bodies to
           the soil
         This organic material will eventually create
           an organic horizon

         Where decomposition ratees are slue (due to
           anaerobic conditions or cold climate), the
           organic horizons (O) can become very thick

      [Topography]
         Soil will not form on slopes >45 degrees
            mass wasting process
         Thickest soils in valleys
         thinnest on mountain slopes

      [Climate]
         soil development is accelerated in warm, wet
           environments
            results in more biological activity and
              enhanced chemical weathering
            more biological activity does not always
              equal more organic matter
         Precipitation and temperature important
           factors in plant growth
         But higher temps and adequate water also means
           higher rates of decomposition

      [Time]
         The longer a soil has to form, the more
           developed it becomes
            more weathering products
            more organic material
         it is the ONLY independent soil forming factor

      [Parent Material]
         Recall the weathering process
            Rocks weather physically and chemically
              sands, silts, and clays
            the original rock is called the "Parent
              material"
            The sediments that are derived from the
              rock can be incorporated into the soil
              material
         The chemical make-up of the parent material
           has a direct reflection on the chemical and
           physical make-up of thhe soil

      [Clay Formation]

--[Sedimentary Rocks]--
   Mechanical Weathering
   Chemical Weathering

   Clastic and Non-Clastic rocks
      clastic is defined by clast size
      non-clastic is defined by composition
   [Clastic Rocks]
      Formed from clasts (bits and pieces of pre-
        existing rocks)
      the major processes in clastic rock formation
        are:
         weathering
         transport
         Deposition
         lithification
      Weathering process continue to alter the clasts
        unlit deposition

      Wentworth Size Scale
         Boulders
         Cobbles
         Gravel (pebbles)
         Sand
         Silt
         Clay
         (biggest to smallest)

      Erosion and Transport
         Water
         Wind
         Ice
         Gravity
         Good at sorting
            Wind
            Water
         Bad at sorting
            Ice
            Gravity
      Clast Sorting
         The farther the clasts have traveled from the
           source, the more well sorted they tend to be
         (well sorted is roughly same sized particles)
         (poorly sorted has some bigger rocks mixed in)
         sorting is based on the size
         same size is well sorted

      large Clasts require more energy to transport
        than small clasts. Smaller clasts tend to be
        transported greater distances than larger clasts

      [Clast Rounding]
         Angular (very sharp)
         Subangular (sharp, but relatively smooth)
         Subrounded (not very smooth, but somewhat
           smooth)
         Rounded (Very smooth, almost no rough edges)

         As clasts are rolled around during
           transportation, sharp corners tend to be
           knocked off, and clasts become more rounded
           the farther they are transported
         Angular grains are usually found only near the
           source rock
      [Clast Composition]
         as clasts are transported, weathering breaks
           down unstable minerals, increasing
           transportation distance, thus results in
           clastic deposit with mostly minerals that are
           stable on the surface of the earth (quartz and
           clay)

         bituminous coal
         anthracite (a metamorphic rock)

           been compacted
   Grain Bedding
      larger particles along the bottom
   cross bedding
      sand dunes
      sets of bedded material within rock layer that
        are inclined at angles as large as 35 degrees
        from the horizontal. these latter indicate wind
        blown conditions in either a desert or beach

      [Changes in temperature and pressure]
         The heat source is earth's internal heat
            burial is inevitabaly accompanied by an
              increase in pressure due to the weight of
              the overlying rocks
            both the temperature and pressure increase
              with depth
         rocks can be heated by a nearby igneous
           intrusion
            an intrusion may be shallow, resulting in
              low pressure, or deep, resulting in high
              pressure.

      {Once we have melting, it is no longer a metamorphic rock, it is igneous}
      [Stress]
         Stress is applied pressure that results in
           deformation in a solid and the development of
           new textures
         texture is controlled by differential vs
