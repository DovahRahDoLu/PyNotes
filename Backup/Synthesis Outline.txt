topic: the value of a life
look more into the 6 ethical approaches(pg. 276)

	what if you were in a situation where you were
presented with a button. if you press it, 3 people who you
will never know will die. if you decide not to press it,
only one person will die, but it is someone close to you.
do you press the button?

	in the runaway trolley car scenario, (statistically) 
most people would chose to kill the one person, and save 5 
people. what if in that situation, you knew the one 
person who had died. would you still be able to kill
that person?(and flip the switch)
	
	both situations take in account the value of a life,
that either a single life is more important than another.
generally, no life is more important than another, even if
you know that person, but some people would chose someone they
know over someone they do not, because they have a connection
to them.
	
	in the fat man and the trolley car, it is much like
the other trolley car scenario, but you must take the physical
action to take a life, rather than flip a switch.
(look into the statistics for both of these scenarios.
