--[evaluating and critical reading]--
   critical reader must be able to evalueate arguments
      when you evaluate an argument (a set of claims),
        you determine its value or persuasiveness.
      to be ale to do a good job evaluating arguments,
        ou need to know what an argument is and how an
        argument is put together

   argment is a claim that iis supported by reasons or
     evidence
      when an author tries to persuade the reader that
        something is true or correct by presenting
        supporting reasons or evidence, an argument is
        being made.
      this means that an argument is different from a
        statement.

   the point of arguing?
      an argument peresents logical reasons and
        evidence to support a viewpoint

           reasonable and should be accepted
      refutation
         opposing viewpoints

   Persuasion

        a claim is true by giving supporting reasons or
        evidence.

   The claim
      the cla9im of an argument is the point of the
        argument.
      when an author makes an argument,its the claim
        that the author is trying to persuade the reader
        to accept as true

            suggests what should or ought to be done to
              solve a problem
   Analysis
      To evaluate an arment, you need to analyze it.
      when you analyze an argument, you break it down
        into its parts and examine them by themselves and
        in relation to the other parts of the argument

      Types of support
         reason

      what do I already know about the issue?


      Read Actively
         read once for an initial impression.
         read the argument several more times
         annotate as you read
         highlight key terms
         diagram or map to analyze strucure

      Strategies for evaluating arguments

         relevancy and sufficiency of evidence
            is there nough of the right kind to support
              the claim
         definition of terms
            should be carefully defined and used
              consistently
         cause-effect relationships
