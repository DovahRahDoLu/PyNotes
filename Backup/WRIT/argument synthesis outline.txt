[What Suffering Does]
  Suffering is opposite of happiness
  ...
  sets limitations for people, allows them to realize
   the boundries of their own abilities
  suffering can change people. "it is not like a
   disease"(check quote)
    SIDENOTE
    I just realized that this doesnt really talk about
     happiness, just about suffering

[Finding Flow]
  basically describes happiness as doing what you love
   to do.
  (from text)
    "The qquality of experience as a function of the
     relationship between challenges and skills. optimal
     exprience, or flow, occurs when both variables are
     high
    "
  
  flow is "being in the zone"(546)
    double check quote
  being in flow is doing what you love.
    I love to write computer programs, and I find
     myself at ease when doing it
    Whenever I take a break from a project or an
     assignment, I often write programs in that time.
    When I am programming, I am in full control, and I
     love to do it ("flow is between arousal and
     control")(chart on 547)

[Pig Happiness]
  it talks about 5 main forms of happiness
    happy idiot
    imcomtetent tottlecap collector
    deluded fool
    successful immoralist
    impossible idealist  
  each one of these types of "personalities",
   categories of happiness, are very different from one
   another, but each one is happy in their own unique
   way. each one finds happiness in what they do, and
   what their situation is.
  people have their own standards of happiness, it is
   their own belief system.. in a way

[In Pursuit of Happiness]
  There is no real definition to happiness.
  happiness is defined by a person themselves.
    since there is no definition of happiness, it is an
     immesurable thing
  anyone can be happy if they do what they think makes
   them happy.
  happiness cannot be defined, cannot be measured, it
   is not biological, it is not genetic..
    Happiness is a Psychological thing
    (look into A BALANCED PSYCHOLOGY AND A FULL LIFE)

  TRY TO STRENGTHEN THE THESIS



[Background for thesis]
  happiness is a state of mind in which we feel at
    ease, where we as people can feel safe, and where we
    always want to be. it is something that cannot be
    measured though, as it differs between each person.
    (pig happiness) One person can be happy collecting
    bottle caps other people are happy with being rich,
    having lots of stuff(try to go into the minimalist).
    Each person defines it in their own way; some people
    are happy when they are in total control, while
    others are happy with having something challenging.

[Thesis Statement]
  Happiness is a state of mind that con only be
    experienced. It cannot be measured, because each not
    everyone experiences happy the same way. (pig
    happiness examples)

[Explain thesis in more depth]
  Happiness is just a way to show that we are in a
    positive state of mind. It tells people that we are
    full of pleasure and enjoyment. People like to be
    happy because:
    people who are happy tend to work better
    be more productive
    they can be more positive
    they are less at stress and not worried
    people who are happy tend to work better:

[Opposing views]

--
  in pursuit of happiness
    they try to define happiness
    want a national measurement of happiness for
      general population
    
    have tried to measure happiness
      explain results
  
  what suffering does
    just mention the fact that it refers to happiness
      is not health, as suffering is not disease
    possibly mention this
  
  A Balanced Psychology and a Full Life
    the author states that happiness has 3 defining
      traits:
      1.Pleasure(positive emotion)
      2.Engagement
      3.Meaning
    these are the 3 routes to happiness
      explain in detail each of these to support the
        author's point in defining happiness
  
  Happiness: Enough Already
    says a pharmaceutical company is working  on a new
      drig to make you happier
      (556)
    "if you're totally satisfied with your life and
      with how things are going in the world," says
      Diener, "you don't feel very motivated to work for
      change. Be wary when people tell you you should be
      happier."(556)
    

      moderate and extreme levels of happiness, and
        finding that being happier is not always better.
      *This is the statistical part*
    that quote about 4ish bullet points above is
      incorrect
    
    this shows a measurement of happiness (kinda) and
      also says that being happy isnt always best

[Counter Opposing Argument]
  Happy Like God
    "Happiness is not quantitative or measurable and it
      is not the object of any science, old or new. It
      cannot be cleaned from empirical surveys or
      programmed ito individualts through  a combination
      of behavioral therapy and anti-depressants. If it
      consists in anything, then I think that happiness
      is this "feeling of existance", this sentiment of
      mementary self-sufficiency that is bound up with
      the experience of time"
    (560-61)
  I experience happiness through accomplishing goals
    and whenever I write my computer programs
  I find that I am happy when I am experiencing
    pleasure.

      routes of happiness:
        pleasure, engagement, and meaning
      explain how pleasure grants happiness
  
  Pursuit of Happiness
    defines it as:
      "Pursuit of personal pleasure or an obscure sense
        of inner contentment"(531)
    John Stuart Mill
      "The search for happiness is one of the chief
        sources of unhappiness,"(531)
[REVISED THESIS]
  Happiness is a state of mind that con only be
    experienced. It cannot be measured, because each not
    everyone experiences happiness the same way.
  (new support):
  Too much happiness can be a bad thing
    (Happiness, Enough Already)
  the main cause of unhappiness is trying to find
    happiness


[Conclusion]
  happiness cannot be measured
    The opposite is suffering
    Too little is sadness
    yet too much is not always a good thing
    it differs from person to person
    It has many different meanings
