--[Intro to Sociology]--
   +The sociological perspective
      +Sociological Imagination
      +Focuses on the social context in which people
        live
      +how are people influenced by their society?
      +Society: a group of people who share a culture and territory

      +Social Location
         +"The corners in life that people occupy
           because of where they are located in society"
         +Examples:
            +age
            +gender
            +race
            +occupation
            +income
            +education

      +C.Wright Mills
      +"The sociological imagination enables us to grasp
        the connection between history and biography"
      +History: Each society is located in a broad
        stream of events
      +Biography: Each individual's specific
        experiences, or external influences, become part
        of our thinking and motivation

+Origins of Sociology
   +People have always asked questions about social life
   +Ancient peoples answered them with myths and
     superstition
   +Sociology is the application of science to these
     same questions
   +Seriously emerged in the middle of the 1800's

   +Grew out of social upheaval
   +Major social changes occured in during the end of
     the 1700's and the beginning of the 1800's
      +american revolution
      +french revolution
   +Ideals that individuals hold inalienable rights
   +Fall of "Traditional" Governments

   +Industrial Revolution
      +mass movemetnt into the cities
      +changes in work and family
      +loss of many traditional roles and interaction
        rituals

   +Founders
      +Auguste Comte (1798-1857)
         +What creates social order, instead of anarchy
           and chaos
         +First to propose the application of scientific
           method to the social world
         +Positivism
            +idea that human behavior is subject to
              causal laws like physics
         +called the new science "sociology"
         +greek: logos, study of
         +latin: socius, companion or being with others

         +Sociologist should discover knowledge about
           society, and should apply it to social reform
         +his form of science...
            +closer to being an Armchair Philosopher
         +drawing his conclusions from informal
           observations
         +his conclusions have been abandoned


         +because he coined the term "sociology" he is
           often credited with being the founder of
           science


      +Herbert Spencer
         +1820-1903
         +Disagreed with Comte about the role of
           sociologists as reformers
         +No one should intervene with the evolution of
           society
         +Societies evolve from lower (barbarian) to
           higher (civilized)

         +The most capable members of society survive,
           while the less capable die out
         +Coined the phrase: Survival of the fittest
         +Because of simiilarities to his contemporary
           researcher, his theories are referred to as:
            +Social Darwinism
         +His ideas were social philosophy
         +Ideas have since been discredited

      +Karl Marx
         +1818-1883
         +Exiled from germany for proposing revolution
         +most significant contribution:
         +Materialist version of history
            +land
            +wealth
            +resources

      The Ability to do this is gradually attained
      First, they only take the role of "Significant 
       Others" (ie parents)

       expectations/perspectives of more people

       others think of us in general
         doing things based on what others will think

            Ages 3 to 6
            Pretend to take the roles of specific people

               I as biography
               Me as history
         I is what makes you different
         The "I" is what evaluates social 
          interactions to construct the "Me"
         I is construction, Me is reaction

   Socialization into Gender
      Theories about learning gender
         Identification Theory
            Attributes gender differences in
              personality traits and behavior to

              women
            Specifically attributes gender differences
              to children's awareness of differences in
              external genitals
