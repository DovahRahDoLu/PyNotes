   [Variables and Data Types]
      int
      double
      float
      char
      string
      bool

      integer
      double/float
         fixed point notation
         decimals
         double is twice the size of a float
      char
         one single character only
         ''
         'a', '1', '2', '\n'
      boolean
         true or false
      String
         NOT built in to c++ normally
         array of characters
         contained in ""
         "hello world"
         "a"
         not built into c, but they are built into c++
           using arrays

         REQUIRES header file
         #include <string>
   these datatypes are used to create variables to
     represent what we need to do in our program


   [Variables]
      like a locker
      memory addresses used to store items
      they can only store ONE thing
      must first assign the variable

      give it a type and a name
         any of the above data types
         name is what you come up with
  int length;
  int width;
  int area;

  length = 4;
  width = 5;
  area = length * width;
      int length; <- declaring a variable
      can declare multiple variables of the same type
         on the same line, separate with ',' end with
           ';'
      int area = length * width;
         valid because length and width have int
           variables assigned to them and have been
           initialized/declared
      naming conventions of variables
      can use CamelCase or underscore_variables
         its personal preference

  int main()
  {
      int sum;
      ...
      sum = score1+score2;
      ...
      return 0;
  }
      to make a variable that the programmer or program
        cannot change later on is the keyword
         constant

  const int LENGTH = 48;
   if trying to declare later, then compile error
     because trying to change the value of a constant
     variable
  double number = 2;
      //this will make it 2.0 as the variable

   [input and output]

      datastream is a sequence of data
      input stream is for the program to use
      output stream is the programs output


  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
      int length,width,area;
      cout<<"input length: ";
      cin>>length;
      cout<<"input width: ";
      cin>>width;
      area=length*width;
      cout<<"Area="<<area;
      return 0;
  }

  //can do this for inputs as well
  cout<<"input length and width";
  cin>>length>>width
  //would be separated in input with space or enter
can do cout<<endl;
can do cout<<"\n";
