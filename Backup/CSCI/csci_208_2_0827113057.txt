--[The software process]--
   [Software Engineering]
      a disciplined approach to the design production,
        and maintenance of computer programs
      [Software Life Cycle]
         Problem analysis
         requirements elicitation
         High- and low-level design
         implementation of the design
         testing and verification
         Delivery
         Operation
         Maintenance
   [Programmer Toolboxes]
      Hardware: computers and other devices
      software...
   [Algorithm]
      logical sequcence of descrete steps
   [Goals of Quality Software]
      it works
      it can be modified without excessive time and
        effort
      it is reusable
      it is completed on time and within budget
   [Quality Software Works]
      requirements: describe the service it proides
      specification: written document that tells what a
        program does, but not how
      it must do everything explained in the
        specification
   [Quality software can be modified]
      changes may occur during the design, coding, and
        testing phases
      bug fixes and small changes are made during the
        maintenance phase
      easily modified programs are readable, well
        documented, aand easily understood by other
        humans
   [Quality software is reusable]
      spend extra effort to make components more
        general now in order to save time later
      using code that is already designed implemeted ,
        and tested allows programmers to focus on the
        rest of the program
      this does not require extra effort during
        specification and design phases
   [sOFTWARE sPECIFICATIONS]
      The specification describes what servicees a
        program should provide based on the users'
        requirements
      scenario: sequence of events describing one
        complete execution of the program
      usefull questions:
         what is the expected input and output
         how will errors be handled
         how will the program be used
   [Program Design]
      a program's specification describes what a
        program does, not how it does it
      disign phase: evaluating how a program will
        accomplish its specified task
   [Abstraction]
      A model of a complex system that includes only
        the essential details
      programs are abstractions
      simplify work by hiding complex details
   [Information Hiding]
      the practice of hiding the details of a module
        with the goal of controlling access to the
        details of a module
      Module: a cohesive system subuinit that performs
        some share of the work
      Iformation hiding allows programmers to focus on
        one module at a time
      each module should serve a single purpose
