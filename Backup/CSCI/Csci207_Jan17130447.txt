   [Variables and Data Types]
      int
      double
      float
      char
      string
      bool

      integer
      double/float
         fixed point notation
         decimals
         double is twice the size of a float
      char
         one single character only
         ''
         'a', '1', '2', '\n'
      boolean
         true or false
      String
         NOT built in to c++ normally
         array of characters
         contained in ""
         "hello world"
         "a"
         not built into c, but they are built into c++
           using arrays

         REQUIRES header file
         #include <string>
   these datatypes are used to create variables to
     represent what we need to do in our program


   [Variables]
      like a locker
      memory addresses used to store items
      they can only store ONE thing
      must first assign the variable

      give it a type and a name
         any of the above data types
         name is what you come up with
  int length;
  int width;
  int area;

  length = 4;
  width = 5;
  area = length * width;
