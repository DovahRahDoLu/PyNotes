--[The software process]--
   [Software Engineering]
      a disciplined approach to the design production,
        and maintenance of computer programs
      [Software Life Cycle]
         Problem analysis
         requirements elicitation
         High- and low-level design
         implementation of the design
         testing and verification
         Delivery
         Operation
         Maintenance
   [Programmer Toolboxes]
      Hardware: computers and other devices
      software...
   [Algorithm]
      logical sequcence of descrete steps
   [Goals of Quality Software]
      it works
      it can be modified without excessive time and
        effort
      it is reusable
      it is completed on time and within budget
   [Quality Software Works]
      requirements: describe the service it proides
      specification: written document that tells what a
        program does, but not how
      it must do everything explained in the
        specification
   [Quality software can be modified]
      changes may occur during the design, coding, and
        testing phases
      bug fixes and small changes are made during the
        maintenance phase
      easily modified programs are readable, well
        documented, aand easily understood by other
        humans
