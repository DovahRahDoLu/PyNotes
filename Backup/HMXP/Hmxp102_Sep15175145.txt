thesis about risk, challenge, or value of self study.
   Self study is both fulfilling and difficult to
     accomplish
      it is fulfilling because you learn about
        yourself,
      yet it is difficult because we as humans must
        challenge what we believe and to find truth we
        must first doubt
Examples to support the thesis from the reader:
   Plato's allegory of the cave
      The prisoner who escaped studied the world around
        him as well as himself, and the experience of
        learning about himself was fulfilling yet as he
        had returned to the cave he was reticuled by
        those around him, introducing the risks and
        challenges behind self study.

      because he studied himself he was rejected and
        challenged by the rest of the prisoners.


   But This I Can Believe (Winter)
      The risks of self study

      Those who challenge their belief in faith and go
        towards science are many times lost and confused
        between which to believe, which is right.

Example from the glass castle
   When Jeannette was burned from cooking hot dogs, she
     was still too young to realize what sort of
     situation she was in and was not as "self-aware"
     because of her age.



Thesis (redone)
   The study of the self is that which is fulfilling,
     but can only be achieved through taking risks and
     facing challenges head on, otherwise nothing shall
     be learned about the self.


glass castle relation (redone)
   same event, but because of the ignorance of her age
     she responded to the event differently
