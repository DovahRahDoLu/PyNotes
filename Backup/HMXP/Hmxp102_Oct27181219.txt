thesis about risk, challenge, or value of self study.
   Self study is both fulfilling and difficult to
     accomplish
      it is fulfilling because you learn about
        yourself,
      yet it is difficult because we as humans must
        challenge what we believe and to find truth we
        must first doubt
Examples to support the thesis from the reader:
   Plato's allegory of the cave
      The prisoner who escaped studied the world around
        him as well as himself, and the experience of
        learning about himself was fulfilling yet as he
        had returned to the cave he was reticuled by
        those around him, introducing the risks and
        challenges behind self study.

      because he studied himself he was rejected and
        challenged by the rest of the prisoners.


   But This I Can Believe (Winter)
      The risks of self study

      Those who challenge their belief in faith and go
        towards science are many times lost and confused
        between which to believe, which is right.

Example from the glass castle
   When Jeannette was burned from cooking hot dogs, she
     was still too young to realize what sort of
     situation she was in and was not as "self-aware"
     because of her age.



Thesis (redone)
   The study of the self is that which is fulfilling,
     but can only be achieved through taking risks and
     facing challenges head on, otherwise nothing shall
     be learned about the self.


glass castle relation (redone)
   same event, but because of the ignorance of her age
     she responded to the event differently

   this relates to the ignorance of the people in the
     cave, the people in the cave are ignorant like the
     girl who was burned.


sidenotes..

   Kilbourne

        biased or loyal to the group as well as be
        effected by the prejudice of the group
      the self and the group, to be an individual or a
        statistic (or a stereotype) of a group

      Advertisements are what lead our society,
        culture, and norms , no matter how hard we may
        try to avoid or accept advertisements

   Thesis: self and other relationship


Meyers
   self other
      Those who fall into a group become less of the
        individual [self] and more of a larger body [the
        other].
      losing individuality*
      influences
      the larger body influences the individuals'
        values and ideals

thesis
   use meyers and kilbourne
      the individual has its own values, ideals,
        beliefs that seperates it from the other or
        larger group[meyers] which  would influence the
        individual's values or ideals.
      the individual is a social construct, the
        autonomous self[identity]
      [kilbourne] media would be the larger group that
        may influence us because it influences society's
        values and norms
      not letting society influence the
        individual[emerson]

   emerson:
      not allowing society to influence the beliefs of
        the individual
   kilbourne:
      the media is said larger group, society, and
        media dictates the norms of society and its
        values. such as fashion or things in "style"
   meyers
      if the individual[autonomous self] were to be
        part of a larger group[society], it causes a loss
        of individuality along with the individuals'
        values and ideals to society's values and ideals
         as one becomes part of the other larger group,
           the group's values and beliefs influence
           (positively and/or negatively) on the
           individual, and can cause that loss of the
           individual.
   Use the first thing I said in the thesis
   also... the individual is should be one of a kind
     rather than a part of the whole of society, just a
     statistic or stereotype
