thesis about risk, challenge, or value of self study.
   Self study is both fulfilling and difficult to
     accomplish
      it is fulfilling because you learn about
        yourself,
      yet it is difficult because we as humans must
        challenge what we believe and to find truth we
        must first doubt
Examples to support the thesis from the reader:
   Plato's allegory of the cave
      The prisoner who escaped studied the world around
        him as well as himself, and the experience of
        learning about himself was fulfilling yet as he
        had returned to the cave he was reticuled by
        those around him, introducing the risks and
        challenges behind self study.

      because he studied himself he was rejected and
        challenged by the rest of the prisoners.


   But This I Can Believe (Winter)
      The risks of self study

      Those who challenge their belief in faith and go
        towards science are many times lost and confused
        between which to believe, which is right.

Example from the glass castle
   When Jeannette was burned from cooking hot dogs, she
     was still too young to realize what sort of
     situation she was in and was not as "self-aware"
     because of her age.



Thesis (redone)
   The study of the self is that which is fulfilling,
     but can only be achieved through taking risks and
     facing challenges head on, otherwise nothing shall
     be learned about the self.


glass castle relation (redone)
   same event, but because of the ignorance of her age
     she responded to the event differently

   this relates to the ignorance of the people in the
     cave, the people in the cave are ignorant like the
     girl who was burned.


sidenotes..

Meyers
   self other

      losing individuality*
      influences
      the larger body influences the individuals'
        values and ideals

thesis
   use meyers and kilbourne
      the individual has its own values, ideals,
        beliefs that seperates it from the other or
        larger group[meyers] which  would influence the
        individual's values or ideals.
      the individual is a social construct, the
        autonomous self[identity]
      [kilbourne] media would be the larger group that
        may influence us because it influences society's
        values and norms
      not letting society influence the
        individual[emerson]

   emerson:
      not allowing society to influence the beliefs of
        the individual
   kilbourne:
      the media is said larger group, society, and
        media dictates the norms of society and its
        values. such as fashion or things in "style"
   meyers
      if the individual[autonomous self] were to be
        part of a larger group[society], it causes a loss
        of individuality along with the individuals'
        values and ideals to society's values and ideals
         as one becomes part of the other larger group,
           the group's values and beliefs influence
           (positively and/or negatively) on the
           individual, and can cause that loss of the
           individual.
   Use the first thing I said in the thesis
   also... the individual is should be one of a kind
     rather than a part of the whole of society, just a
     statistic or stereotype

self and nature connection
--[New York City]--
   Compare to meyers ingroup and outgroup

   So for this presentation, I decided to select the
     section of when jeanette and Carol were walking down
     on broadway when jeanette gave money to a homeless
     person and Carol disapproved of that, saying "You
     shouldnt do that... It only encourages them. They're
     all scam artists"
      That stereotyping of homeless people from a
        privileged university student was a perfect
        example of Myers' "Ingroup and Outgroup"
      I believe that it is a good example because
        within the article of ingroup and outgroup, Myers
        notes that those who are in different groups are
        often stereotyped, very much how Carol had stated
        the stereotype that
         Homeless People are All Scam Artists
      Because of the fact that Jeanette has been in
        both groups, that of the poor low income, and
        that of those who can afford to go to college.
        which is why Jeanette wanted to respond to Carol:
        "What do you know?"
   Later on, in Jeanette's class lecture, her favorite
     professor had been talking about homelessness and
     the cause of it. Her professor questioned the class
     if it was what the republicans said and it was
     because of drug abuse or what the liberals said and
     because there was not enough economic opporitunities
     for the poor.
   When Jeanette answered by saying neither, her
     professor had started to sort of attack Jeanette
     with questions:
      "are you saying homeless people WANT to live on
        the streets?
      "are you saying they don't want warm beds and
        roofs over their heads?
      "What do you know about the hardships and
        obstacles that the underclass face?
   These questions started to single out Jeanette from
     the group of the classroom as her professor was
     quite aggitated from the question. Not wanting to
     give her life story to the class, Jeanette had stood
     down on the topic.

   Seeing that Carol had looked down upon the homeless,
     calling them scam artists, jeanette did not want to
     say that her parents where homeless for reasons that
     did not involve economic opportunities NOR for drug
     abuse
