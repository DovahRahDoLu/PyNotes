   Born in Moscow
      June 6, 1799
   Recieved his early education from russian and french
     tutors

   /////
   taught by russian and french tutors
   from age 12, studied at the
      Imperial Lyceum near St. Peetersburg

      shortly after, began writing his first poems.
   after 1817 graduation, he accepted a post in the
     foreign  affairs ministry in st. petersburg.
   most important works appeard shortly:
      Ruslan and Lyudmila

--[Middle Life]--
   1831, married Natalya Goncharova
      who[natalya] would soon become a favorite
        celebrity at the imperial court.

   Pushkin resented the lowly post he was given there
     as means for the Tsar to invite Goncharova to the
     palace balls.
   Goncharova's imprudent lifestyle sent pushkin deeply
     into debt

MY THOUGHTS ON IT
   pushkin was not as much as a composer as he was a
     writer/poet/novelist.
   His works inspired many composers, who later turned
     his literatuary works into songs, operas, cantatas,
     and ballets

   He was most famous for his literature
      The songs and pieces that were composed did have
        the same name as the original pieces though
      (they were a musical version on the stories
      )
These are my thoughts on the matter of pushkin
