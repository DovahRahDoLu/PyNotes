   if is even when, for each x in the domain of
     f,f(-x)=f(x)
   if f(x) == f(-x), its even
   if the function is opposite, then it is odd

--[1.9: inverse functions]--
   let f and g be to functions such that :
      f(g(x)) = x for every x in the domain of g
      and
      g(f(x)) for every domain of f.

      under these condtions, the function of g is the
        inverse function of the f.
      the function g is denoted by f^-1 (read
        "f-inverse")
         so f(f-1(x)) = x and f-1(f(x)) = x
         the domain of f must be equal to the range of
           f-inverse, and the range of f must be equal to
           the domain of f-inverse
