--[Blizzard Core Values]--
   -Gameplay first
   -Commit to quality
      -a good game is not a rushed game
   -Play nice; Play fair
      -The community of all of the blizzard games I have
        played is by far the friendliest of any community
      -Every player is there to help one another
   -Embrace your inner geek
      -I believe that is very valuable in a company, and
        that doing so will help with new ideas and
        creations
   -Every Voice matters
      -they said:
         -some of our [best](citation needed) ideas come
           from outside of our development team
      -Being in a company where I was able to put in my
        voice even though I was working with something
        else really allowed me to feel a part of a
        company
      -I believe this is extremely important in the core
        values of any company for that company to be able
        to thrive
      -<0
   -Think Globally
      -(best way to think is to think outside the box,
        to be able to get new and suprizing ideas)
      -<0
   -Lead Responsibly
      -I believe that leading responsibly is a large
        factor, and can include the core value of every
        voice matters.
