--[What is Philosophy]--
   (means love of wisdom)

   The Goals of Philosophy
      Truth
         The account (logos) of everything
            Theoretical (a third-person or neutral
              account)
      Goodness
            Practical (a first-person account of how to
              live well)

   Three Questions
      Metaphysics: What is it?
         alfred north whitehead
            starts from ground: particular obsrvation
            flight: imaginative generalization
            lands for renewed obervation  by rational
              interpretation

            use generalization for better understanding
              of observations

      Epistemology: How do I know?
         Walter Kaufmann:
            "the intensity of great philosophy and
              poetry is abnormal and subversive: it is
              the enemy of habit, custom, and all
              stereotypes. The motto is always that what
              is well known is not well known at all
              well."
               to challenge what is known
               what is so commonly known may be
                 questioned as it is usually generally
                 accepted rather that questioned
         Denis Diderot:
            "The first step toward truth is doubt."
               known for accumulatint all knowledge
                 into an encyclopedia...
         William Halverson:
            "Philosophy is man's quest for the unity of
              knowledge: it consists in a perpetual
              struggle to create the concepts in which
              the universe can be concieved as a universe
              and not a multiverse."
               description of reality: different fields
                 may describe it in different ways of the
                 same reality.
               Halverson says quest is to unify these
                 descriptions.
      Value Theory: What is it worth?
         Plato:
            "And is not philosophy the practice for
              death?"
               philosophy is "preparing the soul" for
                 death
                  belief that knowledge is kept with
                    soul after death.
         Marx:
            "The Philosophers have only interpreted the
              world, in various ways. The point, however,
              is to change it."
               saying that goal of philosophy is to try
                 to find the good.


   Empiricism and Rationalism
      Empiricism:
         using senses. actuality
         means to experience
      Rationalism:
         logic and thought
         Reason

      university of paris
         challenged aristotle's theory of motion
         new observations showed the aristotle could be
           wrong
         (1300's)
      Descartes: think about observing the sun or a
        tower in the distance
         what contribution does reason make? whyy must
           it do so?

--[Truth and Logic]--
   Truth Value Analysis
      Determines if the information in the premises is
        accurate, correct, or true (is it a true or false
        statement?)
         -"is it raining"
   Logical Analysis
      Determines the strength with which the premises
        support the conclusiion (is it a valid or invalid
        argument?)
         -Premises:
            a)it is raining
            b)when it rains, games are postponed
         -Conclusion
            -Therefore, the game is postponed


   Deductive and Inductive Arguments
      Deductive argument
         ONe in which it is claimed that:
            -The conclusion follows necessarily from the
              premises
            -True premises make it impossible for the
              conclusion to be false
      Inductive argument
         one in which it is claimed that:
            -The premises make the conclusion probable
            -True premises make it improbalbe for the
              conclusion to be false
      Key words/pphrases
         Deductive:
            necesarily, certainty, definitely
         Inductive:
            Probably, likely, unlikely, plausible
      Strength of argument
         Deductive:
            conclusion necessarily true
         iinductive:
            conclusion only probably true
      Types of arguments
         deductive:
            mathematics, geometry, definitions
         inductive:
            legal, moral, statistical, scientific


      Deductive reasoning begins with premises and
        shows that conclusion must follow.
         the inference is "timeless" or always the case
         the premise does not require experience
            -a priori
               knowing things without prior experience
   Inductive reasoning begins with examples from
     experience and draws conclusions about what further
     experience will probably yield.
            A posteriori
         it makes a generalization from the past to
           predict the future.
            -a)a1 is b
            -b)a2 is b
            -c)a3 is b
            -therefore, all a's are probably b.



      Deductive reasoning
         Socrates is a man.
         all men are mortal
         therefore socrates is mortal

         S is M.
         All M are P.
         Therefore, S is P is valid
         invalid:
            s is m
            all d are m
            therefore, s is d.
            INVALID



   Two Valid Conditional Arguments
      Modus Ponens
      (affirming the antecedent)
         -if P, then Q.
         -P.
         -therefore, Q.
      Modus Tollens
      (denying the antecendent)
         -if P, then Q.
         -not Q.
         -therefore, P is not Q
   Valid Deductions?
      denying the antecedent
         if p,then q
         not p
         therefore, not q
      affirming the consequent
         if p,then q
         q
         therefore, p

      valid.. invalid..

   Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
      Sufficient condition
         -That which is enough for something to be the
           case; when the truth of the antecedent
           guarantees the truth of the consequent
      Necessary condition:
         -That which is >Required or mandatory< for
           something to be the case; the falsity of the
           consequence ensures the falsity of the
           antecedent

   Reductio ad absurdum
      if you are asked to show p is true, you could
        show it by way of a reductio ad absurdum
         -start by assuming P is not true.
         -then show that assumption leads to an absurd
           conclusion (i.e., one that contradicts the
           assumption).
         -then conclude the original assumption (P is
           not true) was false
         -so p is true after all

   Abductive reasoning
      reasoning from the bresent backwards to what best
        explains the present.
      also, a posteriori
      abductive is also probative


   Logical Fallacies
      Ad hominem
      argument from authority
      arguing in a circle
         begging the question
      argument from ignorance
      false dilemma
      slippery slope
      straw man argument (rad herring)
      genetic fallacy
      inconsistency

--[The Self]--
   [[ Locke ]]
      Substance and Properties
      Substance
         My Dog
      Properties
         brown and white, getting old, losing hearing

      Substance
         in general, bearer of the properties, that
           which has the properties
      Properties
         the properties are what we can know about a
           substance; Lock is an >Empiricist<. Properties
           are our access to knowing what something (its
           substance) is.


      Human Being
         the kind of substance that bears or has the
           broperties of a human being
         [Properties]
            Biological attributes of Homo Sapiens
              (physical description)
      Person
         the kind of substance that bears or has the
           properties of a person
         [Properties]
            Intelligence, Reason, Reflection
            Self-consciousness

         Substance (the 'what' someone is)
         the same over time?
         [Properties]
            Changing experiences
            Judging by my experiences-the properties to
              which I have access, I might say no.
            But as an intelligent being, I have MEMORY. Note
              that I am able to access my memory be being SELF-
              CONSCIOUS
            Memory (through self-consciousness) ties my changing
              experiences together; it is the thread that unites
              my different experiences to one substance-which is
              my >self<.
      Tabula rasa

      Ambiguity of "self-consciousness"
         In self-consciousness,
            -Am I conscious of my self (the substance)?
            -or of the properties of my self (my experiences-both
              present and remembered)?
            -it seems like a strong answer to say the former-my
              self,
            -but a strict empiricist might say we only have
              access to the properties which whatever is being
              presented in the "theater" of the mind.


   [[ Hume ]]
      The strict empiricist
      his motto:
         -"no impression, no idea"
      in other words, our ideas are emptyy  or
        imaginary unless they are based on actual
        experiences or impressions from the senses.
      be careful in assuming that our ideas name real
        things.
         (think of obvious mistakes like attributing a
           cause when there was only coincidence: since I
           wore this hat my favorite team won, therefore
           wearing the hat made the team win. Hume's rule
           says: dont believe in something unless you
           really experienced it-in this case, the >real
           connection< between the events involved.)
      We have the habit of grouping our impressions to
        form our ideas. the grouping techniques are:

         -resemblance
         -Contiguity
         -Cause and effect
      This habit leads us to believe in the identity
        over time of various substances.
         -E.g., that is the same chair that was here
           yesterday
         -strictly speaking, I can only say,, the
           impressions I have today >resemble< the
           impressions I had yesterday.
         -i cannot see (or sense) its underlying
           substance, only its changing properties.


      What about the self?
         -Be an empiricist and think about your
           experience: notice the multitude of fleeting
           impressions.
            -"I never catch myself at any time without a
              perception, and never obseve any thing but
              the perception."
   [[ Kant ]]
