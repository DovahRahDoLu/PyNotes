--[What is Philosophy]--
   (means love of wisdom)

   The Goals of Philosophy
      Truth
         The account (logos) of everything
            Theoretical (a third-person or neutral
              account)
      Goodness
            Practical (a first-person account of how to
              live well)

   Three Questions
      Metaphysics: What is it?
         alfred north whitehead
            starts from ground: particular obsrvation
            flight: imaginative generalization
            lands for renewed obervation  by rational
              interpretation

            use generalization for better understanding
              of observations

      Epistemology: How do I know?
         Walter Kaufmann:
            "the intensity of great philosophy and
              poetry is abnormal and subversive: it is
              the enemy of habit, custom, and all
              stereotypes. The motto is always that what
              is well known is not well known at all
              well."
               to challenge what is known
               what is so commonly known may be
                 questioned as it is usually generally
                 accepted rather that questioned
         Denis Diderot:
            "The first step toward truth is doubt."
               known for accumulatint all knowledge
                 into an encyclopedia...
         William Halverson:
            "Philosophy is man's quest for the unity of
              knowledge: it consists in a perpetual
              struggle to create the concepts in which
              the universe can be concieved as a universe
              and not a multiverse."
               description of reality: different fields
                 may describe it in different ways of the
                 same reality.
               Halverson says quest is to unify these
                 descriptions.
      Value Theory: What is it worth?
         Plato:
            "And is not philosophy the practice for
              death?"
               philosophy is "preparing the soul" for
                 death
                  belief that knowledge is kept with
                    soul after death.
         Marx:
            "The Philosophers have only interpreted the
              world, in various ways. The point, however,
              is to change it."
               saying that goal of philosophy is to try
                 to find the good.


   Empiricism and Rationalism
      Empiricism:
         using senses. actuality
         means to experience
      Rationalism:
         logic and thought
         Reason

      university of paris
         challenged aristotle's theory of motion
         new observations showed the aristotle could be
           wrong
         (1300's)
      Descartes: think about observing the sun or a
        tower in the distance
         what contribution does reason make? whyy must

--[Truth and Logic]--
   Truth Value Analysis
      Determines if the information in the premises is
        accurate, correct, or true (is it a true or false
        statement?)
         -"is it raining"
   Logical Analysis
      Determines the strength with which the premises
        support the conclusiion (is it a valid or invalid
        argument?)
         -Premises:
            a)it is raining
            b)when it rains, games are postponed
         -Conclusion
            -Therefore, the game is postponed


   Deductive and Inductive Arguments
      Deductive argument
         ONe in which it is claimed that:
            -The conclusion follows necessarily from the
              premises
            -True premises make it impossible for the
              conclusion to be false
      Inductive argument
         one in which it is claimed that:
            -The premises make the conclusion probable
            -True premises make it improbalbe for the
              conclusion to be false
      Key words/pphrases
         Deductive:
            necesarily, certainty, definitely
         Inductive:
            Probably, likely, unlikely, plausible
      Strength of argument
         Deductive:
            conclusion necessarily true
         iinductive:
            conclusion only probably true
      Types of arguments
         deductive:
            mathematics, geometry, definitions
         inductive:
            legal, moral, statistical, scientific


      Deductive reasoning begins with premises and
        shows that conclusion must follow.
         the inference is "timeless" or always the case
         the premise does not require experience
            -a priori
               knowing things without prior experience
   Inductive reasoning begins with examples from
     experience and draws conclusions about what further
     experience will probably yield.
            A posteriori
         it makes a generalization from the past to
           predict the future.
            -a)a1 is b
            -b)a2 is b
            -c)a3 is b
            -therefore, all a's are probably b.
