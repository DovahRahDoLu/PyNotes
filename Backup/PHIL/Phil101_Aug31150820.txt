   (means love of wisdom)

   The Goals of Philosophy
      Truth
         The account (logos) of everything
            Theoretical (a third-person or neutral
              account)
      Goodness
            Practical (a first-person account of how to
              live well)

   Three Questions
      Metaphysics: What is it?
         alfred north whitehead
            starts from ground: particular obsrvation
            flight: imaginative generalization
            lands for renewed obervation  by rational
              interpretation

            use generalization for better understanding
              of observations

      Epistemology: How do I know?
         Walter Kaufmann:
            "the intensity of great philosophy and
              poetry is abnormal and subversive: it is
              the enemy of habit, custom, and all
              stereotypes. The motto is always that what
              is well known is not well known at all
              well."
               to challenge what is known
               what is so commonly known may be
                 questioned as it is usually generally
                 accepted rather that questioned
         Denis Diderot:
            "The first step toward truth is doubt."
               known for accumulatint all knowledge
                 into an encyclopedia...
         William Halverson:
            "Philosophy is man's quest for the unity of
              knowledge: it consists in a perpetual
              struggle to create the concepts in which
              the universe can be concieved as a universe
              and not a multiverse."
               description of reality: different fields
                 may describe it in different ways of the
                 same reality.
               Halverson says quest is to unify these
                 descriptions.
      Value Theory: What is it worth?
         Plato:
            "And is not philosophy the practice for
              death?"
               philosophy is "preparing the soul" for
                 death
                  belief that knowledge is kept with
                    soul after death.
         Marx:
            "The Philosophers have only interpreted the
              world, in various ways. The point, however,
              is to change it."
               saying that goal of philosophy is to try
                 to find the good.


   Empiricism and Rationalism
      Empiricism:
         using senses. actuality
         means to experience
      Rationalism:
         logic and thought
         Reason

      university of paris
         challenged aristotle's theory of motion
         new observations showed the aristotle could be
           wrong
         (1300's)

        tower in the distance
