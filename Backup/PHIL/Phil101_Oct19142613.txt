--[What is Philosophy]--
   (means love of wisdom)

   The Goals of Philosophy
      Truth
         The account (logos) of everything
            Theoretical (a third-person or neutral
              account)
      Goodness
            Practical (a first-person account of how to
              live well)

   Three Questions
      Metaphysics: What is it?
         alfred north whitehead
            starts from ground: particular obsrvation
            flight: imaginative generalization
            lands for renewed obervation  by rational
              interpretation

            use generalization for better understanding
              of observations

      Epistemology: How do I know?
         Walter Kaufmann:
            "the intensity of great philosophy and
              poetry is abnormal and subversive: it is
              the enemy of habit, custom, and all
              stereotypes. The motto is always that what
              is well known is not well known at all
              well."
               to challenge what is known
               what is so commonly known may be
                 questioned as it is usually generally
                 accepted rather that questioned
         Denis Diderot:
            "The first step toward truth is doubt."
               known for accumulatint all knowledge
                 into an encyclopedia...
         William Halverson:
            "Philosophy is man's quest for the unity of
              knowledge: it consists in a perpetual
              struggle to create the concepts in which
              the universe can be concieved as a universe
              and not a multiverse."
               description of reality: different fields
                 may describe it in different ways of the
                 same reality.
               Halverson says quest is to unify these
                 descriptions.
      Value Theory: What is it worth?
         Plato:
            "And is not philosophy the practice for
              death?"
               philosophy is "preparing the soul" for
                 death
                  belief that knowledge is kept with
                    soul after death.
         Marx:
            "The Philosophers have only interpreted the
              world, in various ways. The point, however,
              is to change it."
               saying that goal of philosophy is to try
                 to find the good.


   Empiricism and Rationalism
      Empiricism:
         using senses. actuality
         means to experience
      Rationalism:
         logic and thought
         Reason

      university of paris
         challenged aristotle's theory of motion
         new observations showed the aristotle could be
           wrong
         (1300's)
      Descartes: think about observing the sun or a
        tower in the distance
         what contribution does reason make? whyy must
           it do so?

--[Truth and Logic]--
   Truth Value Analysis
      Determines if the information in the premises is
        accurate, correct, or true (is it a true or false
        statement?)
         -"is it raining"
   Logical Analysis
      Determines the strength with which the premises
        support the conclusiion (is it a valid or invalid
        argument?)
         -Premises:
            a)it is raining
            b)when it rains, games are postponed
         -Conclusion
            -Therefore, the game is postponed


   Deductive and Inductive Arguments
      Deductive argument
         ONe in which it is claimed that:
            -The conclusion follows necessarily from the
              premises
            -True premises make it impossible for the
              conclusion to be false
      Inductive argument
         one in which it is claimed that:
            -The premises make the conclusion probable
            -True premises make it improbalbe for the
              conclusion to be false
      Key words/pphrases
         Deductive:
            necesarily, certainty, definitely
         Inductive:
            Probably, likely, unlikely, plausible
      Strength of argument
         Deductive:
            conclusion necessarily true
         iinductive:
            conclusion only probably true
      Types of arguments
         deductive:
            mathematics, geometry, definitions
         inductive:
            legal, moral, statistical, scientific


      Deductive reasoning begins with premises and
        shows that conclusion must follow.
         the inference is "timeless" or always the case
         the premise does not require experience
            -a priori
               knowing things without prior experience
   Inductive reasoning begins with examples from
     experience and draws conclusions about what further
     experience will probably yield.
            A posteriori
         it makes a generalization from the past to
           predict the future.
            -a)a1 is b
            -b)a2 is b
            -c)a3 is b
            -therefore, all a's are probably b.



      Deductive reasoning
         Socrates is a man.
         all men are mortal
         therefore socrates is mortal

         S is M.
         All M are P.
         Therefore, S is P is valid
         invalid:
            s is m
            all d are m
            therefore, s is d.
            INVALID



   Two Valid Conditional Arguments
      Modus Ponens
      (affirming the antecedent)
         -if P, then Q.
         -P.
         -therefore, Q.
      Modus Tollens
      (denying the antecendent)
         -if P, then Q.
         -not Q.
         -therefore, P is not Q
   Valid Deductions?
      denying the antecedent
         if p,then q
         not p
         therefore, not q
      affirming the consequent
         if p,then q
         q
         therefore, p

      valid.. invalid..

   Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
      Sufficient condition
         -That which is enough for something to be the
           case; when the truth of the antecedent
           guarantees the truth of the consequent
      Necessary condition:
         -That which is >Required or mandatory< for
           something to be the case; the falsity of the
           consequence ensures the falsity of the
           antecedent

   Reductio ad absurdum
      if you are asked to show p is true, you could
        show it by way of a reductio ad absurdum
         -start by assuming P is not true.
         -then show that assumption leads to an absurd
           conclusion (i.e., one that contradicts the
           assumption).
         -then conclude the original assumption (P is
           not true) was false
         -so p is true after all

   Abductive reasoning
      reasoning from the bresent backwards to what best
        explains the present.
      also, a posteriori
      abductive is also probative


   Logical Fallacies
      Ad hominem
      argument from authority
      arguing in a circle
         begging the question
      argument from ignorance
      false dilemma
      slippery slope
      straw man argument (rad herring)
      genetic fallacy
      inconsistency

      Substance and Properties
      Substance
         My Dog
      Properties
         brown and white, getting old, losing hearing

      Substance
         in general, bearer of the properties, that
           which has the properties
      Properties
         the properties are what we can know about a
           substance; Lock is an >Empiricist<. Properties
           are our access to knowing what something (its
           substance) is.


      Human Being
         the kind of substance that bears or has the
           broperties of a human being
         [Properties]
            Biological attributes of Homo Sapiens
              (physical description)
      Person
         the kind of substance that bears or has the
           properties of a person
         [Properties]
            Intelligence, Reason, Reflection
            Self-consciousness

         Substance (the 'what' someone is)
         the same over time?
         [Properties]
            Changing experiences
            Judging by my experiences-the properties to
              which I have access, I might say no.
            But as an intelligent being, I have MEMORY. Note
              that I am able to access my memory be being SELF-
              CONSCIOUS
            Memory (through self-consciousness) ties my changing
              experiences together; it is the thread that unites
              my different experiences to one substance-which is
              my >self<.
      Tabula rasa

      Ambiguity of "self-consciousness"
         In self-consciousness,
            -Am I conscious of my self (the substance)?
            -or of the properties of my self (my experiences-both
              present and remembered)?
            -it seems like a strong answer to say the former-my
              self,
            -but a strict empiricist might say we only have
              access to the properties which whatever is being
              presented in the "theater" of the mind.


   [[ Hume ]]
      The strict empiricist
      his motto:
         -"no impression, no idea"
      in other words, our ideas are emptyy  or
        imaginary unless they are based on actual
        experiences or impressions from the senses.
      be careful in assuming that our ideas name real
        things.
         (think of obvious mistakes like attributing a
           cause when there was only coincidence: since I
           wore this hat my favorite team won, therefore
           wearing the hat made the team win. Hume's rule
           says: dont believe in something unless you
           really experienced it-in this case, the >real
           connection< between the events involved.)
      We have the habit of grouping our impressions to
        form our ideas. the grouping techniques are:

         -resemblance
         -Contiguity
         -Cause and effect
      This habit leads us to believe in the identity
        over time of various substances.
         -E.g., that is the same chair that was here
           yesterday
         -strictly speaking, I can only say,, the
           impressions I have today >resemble< the
           impressions I had yesterday.
         -i cannot see (or sense) its underlying
           substance, only its changing properties.


      What about the self?
         -Be an empiricist and think about your
           experience: notice the multitude of fleeting
           impressions.
            -"I never catch myself at any time without a
              perception, and never obseve any thing but
              the perception."
   [[ Kant ]]
      concepts without sensations are empty;
         reading a tour guide
      Sensations without concepts are blind.
         traveling with no background knowledge.
      (first rationalist, second empiricist
      rationalist
         critique of rationalists' ideas:
            productis of the imagination that need to
              apply to some object of experience in order
              for them to have meaning
         the self as a substance-is it just imaginary?
      empiricist
         .... refer to powerpoint

      Hume is right (about one thing)
         our ideas do not (and cannot) apply to any
           object of experience are "empty." That is, we
           can think about them, but we cannot say we
           know what they are (or what thy correspond to
           in reality , if anything).
            ie. round square
      For example, the totality of the universe (all
        space and all time).
      we can think this idea, but we can never know it(
        have cognition of it.
      it is a useful idea for organizing our experience
        of finie things, but it is beyond our cognitive
        capacity to know
      .. powerpoint

      However, we can't be strict empiricists:
         When we focus on our sensations (as
           empiricists encourage), we will notice that
           some mental contributions were necessary or
           required.
         its like watching a movie then noticing the
           set, the lighting, the sound, the
           choreography, etc.
         the "background" that gives an appearance
         these background requirements are the a priori
           contributions of the mind.
         ==?
         a priori=beforehand and necessary
         try to imagine space with nothing in it.
         try to imagine an object (eg, a table) that is
           not in space.
         if you cant do the latter, it shows us that
           the idea of space (or form of space) is
           required to be having sense experience of
           objects in the theater
            if you imagine a table, the would the table
              be in empty space (the mind)
         transcendental philosophy looks for these
           necessary features that make experience
           possible. and strict empiricism will not find
           them
      what about the self?
         notice that your experiences are >unified<:
            sights go together with sounds.
            all of them belong to me
            manifold experience.
            no matter what else they are, they are
              always experienced-by-me.
            the "I think" must accompany all my
              representations.
            thus a notion of the "self" in this sense
              is required even to be a strict empiricist

           contradiction
         conclude existence of god

      St. Anselm (1033-1109)
      ^^^^^^^^^^
         define god as "that than which nothing greater
           can be conceived"
            that is, te Greatest Concieved Being (GCB)
      Proof
         1)Suppose that the reatest concievable being
           (gcb) exists in the mind alone (and not in
           reality)
         2)Existence in reality is greater than existence
           in the mind alone
         3)We can concieve of this GCB existing in
           realiity as well as in the mind
         4)Therefore, we can concieve of a being that is
           greater than the GCB. (From 1,2, and 3)
              -that is saying greater than the greatest.
         5)But this is impossible for it is a
           contradiction.
         6)therefore, it is false that a gcb exists in
           the mind alone and not in realit. so a gcb
           must exist in reality as well as in the mind.
           this being is, by definition, god.

      Gaunilo's Objection:
         The same argument could show that the most
           perfect island must exist.
            that seems suspicious...
         what does the "greatest" mean?
            if "greatest" refers to a measurable
              quantity (such as "the highest mountain"
              then it is an empty concept
      anselm's reply
         true, but od's greatness is not measurable in
           this way
            god's goodness is not quantifiable in this
              sense

      Immanuel kant's (1781) objection:
         being or existence is not a property like
           "blue" or "heavy"
         we are asked to compare two items in anselm's
           proof:
            1. the gcb that exists in the mind but not
              reality
            2. the gcb that esists in the mind and in
              reality
            but what is that first one? is it a
              possible but non-existing being.
               it exists, yet does not exist
               this sounds like a paradox
            also, what about the second one? we are
              forced to suppose that god exists in
              reality in order  to evaluate this
              comparison, but that is Circular Reasoning

--[Problem of Evil]--
[Unit 6]
   JL Mackie and the logical problem of evil
      mackies thesis
      ...
      argument
         1) God Exists
         2) if god exists, then god is omnipotent
         3) if something is omnipotent, it can do
           anything
         4) if god exists, then god can do anything (2,
           3)

         5) if god exists, then god is wholly good.
         6) if something is wholly good, it always
           eliminates as much evil as it can
         7) if god exists, then god eliminates as much
           evil as god can (5,6)
         8) if god exists, then god eliminates all evil
           (4,7)
         9) if god exists, then there is no evil (8)
         10) there is no evil (1, 9)
         11) Some evil exists
         Contradiction: There is evil and there is no
           evil (10,11)


      Logical Problem of Evil
         Discussionn of the argument:
         1) god exists and is omnipotent and wholly
           good
         2) evil exists
         is there a third statement that is necessarily
           true to amake (1) and (2) explicitly
           contradictory?
         8) god will prevent all evil
         necessarily true?
            no, what if the evil is required to bring
              about a greater or outweighing good?
         8a) god will prevent the occurrence of any
           evil that is not required to bring about a
           greater good.
         necessarily true?
         --?
            perhaps, but are 1 and 2 now contradictory
              using 8a? no

         Defense
         ^^^^^^^
            shows that propositions could be
              consistent, ie, that there is a way that
              they might go together though we cannot say
              for sure that they do.
         theodicy:
         ^^^^^^^^
         --?
         -_>
            shows they are consistent for such and such
              reasons, ie, in effect purports to know
              god's reasons.
         summary: if a good and all powerful god might
           have to permit some evils to produce
           outweighing goods that mackie had failed to
           leave out in trying to prove contradiction
           between 1 and 2
   [[ Evidential Problem ]]
      Pointless Evils

         Are there evils that do not serve a purpose?
           that are not required to produce a greater or
           outweighing good?
            -If so, then is (8a) true?
         pointless evils: such of the fawn that dies in
           agony in the forest



         Definition: A Pointless Evils is one that has
           no purpose; that is, it is not required to
           bring about a greater or outweighing good.
         definition: An Evidential Argument is
           inductive... Probability

         modus tollens
            if god exists, there are no pointless evils
            probably there are pointless evils
            therefore, probably, god does not exist
         modus ponens
            defenses: GE Moore Shift
            If god exists, there are no pointless
              evils.
            Probably god does exist
            therefore, probably, there are no pointless

--[Faith and Reason]--
[Unit 7]
   {{ pascal, clifford, and james }}

   Enlightnment assumption:
      all beliefs should be judged in the court of
        reason ad deemed acceptable only if they are
        supported by reason or evidence
         john lock on religion: "whatever god hath
           revealed, is certainly true:...but whether it
           be a revelation or no, reason must judge."
           "reason must be our last guide and judge in
           everything"
   however, Genuine religious belief seems to be based
     on faith, i,e.,
      -it is freely decided
      -      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      -it involves unconditional acceptance
      -            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   -Conundrum: if reason and evidence were the basis of
     religious belief,
      -Either the belief would be provablebeyond
        question--no room for free decision
      -Or the belief would be merely probable--no way
        for unconditional acceptance


   [Two types of rational beliefs]
      [Epistemic rationality]
         A's belief that P is epistemically rational
           iff A has (good) evidence for thinking P true
            rational belief=good evidence and reason
      [Pragmatic rationality]
         A's belief that P is pragmatically rational
           iff believing P is beneficial for A
            rational belief = "useful-to-believe"
              beliefs
            ie: arriving early is beneficial
            good thinking, "I know I am going to do
              well in the class"
               no reason or evidence, just belief
