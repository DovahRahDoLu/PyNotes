--[What is Philosophy]--
   (means love of wisdom)

   The Goals of Philosophy
      Truth
         The account (logos) of everything
            Theoretical (a third-person or neutral
              account)
      Goodness
            Practical (a first-person account of how to
              live well)

   Three Questions
      Metaphysics: What is it?
         alfred north whitehead
            starts from ground: particular obsrvation
            flight: imaginative generalization
            lands for renewed obervation  by rational
              interpretation

            use generalization for better understanding
              of observations

      Epistemology: How do I know?
         Walter Kaufmann:
            "the intensity of great philosophy and
              poetry is abnormal and subversive: it is
              the enemy of habit, custom, and all
              stereotypes. The motto is always that what
              is well known is not well known at all
              well."
               to challenge what is known
               what is so commonly known may be
                 questioned as it is usually generally
                 accepted rather that questioned
         Denis Diderot:
            "The first step toward truth is doubt."
               known for accumulatint all knowledge
                 into an encyclopedia...
         William Halverson:
            "Philosophy is man's quest for the unity of
              knowledge: it consists in a perpetual
              struggle to create the concepts in which
              the universe can be concieved as a universe
              and not a multiverse."
               description of reality: different fields
                 may describe it in different ways of the
                 same reality.
               Halverson says quest is to unify these
                 descriptions.
      Value Theory: What is it worth?
         Plato:
            "And is not philosophy the practice for
              death?"
               philosophy is "preparing the soul" for
                 death
                  belief that knowledge is kept with
                    soul after death.
         Marx:
            "The Philosophers have only interpreted the
              world, in various ways. The point, however,
              is to change it."
               saying that goal of philosophy is to try
                 to find the good.


   Empiricism and Rationalism
      Empiricism:
         using senses. actuality
         means to experience
      Rationalism:
         logic and thought
         Reason

      university of paris
         challenged aristotle's theory of motion
         new observations showed the aristotle could be
           wrong
         (1300's)
      Descartes: think about observing the sun or a
        tower in the distance
         what contribution does reason make? whyy must
           it do so?

--[Truth and Logic]--
   Truth Value Analysis
      Determines if the information in the premises is
        accurate, correct, or true (is it a true or false
        statement?)
         -"is it raining"
   Logical Analysis
      Determines the strength with which the premises
        support the conclusiion (is it a valid or invalid
        argument?)
         -Premises:
            a)it is raining
            b)when it rains, games are postponed
         -Conclusion
            -Therefore, the game is postponed


   Deductive and Inductive Arguments
      Deductive argument
         ONe in which it is claimed that:
            -The conclusion follows necessarily from the
              premises
            -True premises make it impossible for the
              conclusion to be false
      Inductive argument
         one in which it is claimed that:
            -The premises make the conclusion probable
            -True premises make it improbalbe for the
              conclusion to be false
      Key words/pphrases
         Deductive:
            necesarily, certainty, definitely
         Inductive:
            Probably, likely, unlikely, plausible
      Strength of argument
         Deductive:
            conclusion necessarily true
         iinductive:
            conclusion only probably true
      Types of arguments
         deductive:
            mathematics, geometry, definitions
         inductive:
            legal, moral, statistical, scientific


      Deductive reasoning begins with premises and
        shows that conclusion must follow.
         the inference is "timeless" or always the case
         the premise does not require experience
            -a priori
               knowing things without prior experience
   Inductive reasoning begins with examples from
     experience and draws conclusions about what further
     experience will probably yield.
            A posteriori
         it makes a generalization from the past to
           predict the future.
            -a)a1 is b
            -b)a2 is b
            -c)a3 is b
            -therefore, all a's are probably b.



      Deductive reasoning
         Socrates is a man.
         all men are mortal
         therefore socrates is mortal

         S is M.
         All M are P.
         Therefore, S is P is valid
         invalid:
            s is m
            all d are m
            therefore, s is d.
            INVALID



   Two Valid Conditional Arguments
      Modus Ponens
      (affirming the antecedent)
         -if P, then Q.
         -P.
         -therefore, Q.
      Modus Tollens
      (denying the antecendent)
         -if P, then Q.
         -not Q.
         -therefore, P is not Q
   Valid Deductions?
      denying the antecedent
         if p,then q
         not p
         therefore, not q
      affirming the consequent
         if p,then q
         q
         therefore, p

      valid.. invalid..

   Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
      Sufficient condition
         -That which is enough for something to be the
           case; when the truth of the antecedent
           guarantees the truth of the consequent
      Necessary condition:
         -That which is >Required or mandatory< for
           something to be the case; the falsity of the
           consequence ensures the falsity of the
           antecedent

   Reductio ad absurdum
      if you are asked to show p is true, you could
        show it by way of a reductio ad absurdum
         -start by assuming P is not true.
         -then show that assumption leads to an absurd
           conclusion (i.e., one that contradicts the
           assumption).
         -then conclude the original assumption (P is
           not true) was false
         -so p is true after all

   Abductive reasoning
      reasoning from the bresent backwards to what best
        explains the present.
      also, a posteriori
      abductive is also probative


   Logical Fallacies
      Ad hominem
      argument from authority
      arguing in a circle
         begging the question
      argument from ignorance
      false dilemma
      slippery slope
      straw man argument (rad herring)
      genetic fallacy
      inconsistency

      Substance and Properties
      Substance
         My Dog
      Properties
         brown and white, getting old, losing hearing

      Substance
         in general, bearer of the properties, that
           which has the properties
      Properties
         the properties are what we can know about a
           substance; Lock is an >Empiricist<. Properties
           are our access to knowing what something (its
           substance) is.


      Human Being
         the kind of substance that bears or has the
           broperties of a human being
         [Properties]
            Biological attributes of Homo Sapiens
              (physical description)
      Person
         the kind of substance that bears or has the
           properties of a person
         [Properties]
            Intelligence, Reason, Reflection
            Self-consciousness

         Substance (the 'what' someone is)
         the same over time?
         [Properties]
            Changing experiences
            Judging by my experiences-the properties to
              which I have access, I might say no.
            But as an intelligent being, I have MEMORY. Note
              that I am able to access my memory be being SELF-
              CONSCIOUS
            Memory (through self-consciousness) ties my changing
              experiences together; it is the thread that unites
              my different experiences to one substance-which is
              my >self<.
      Tabula rasa

      Ambiguity of "self-consciousness"
         In self-consciousness,
            -Am I conscious of my self (the substance)?
            -or of the properties of my self (my experiences-both
              present and remembered)?
            -it seems like a strong answer to say the former-my
              self,
            -but a strict empiricist might say we only have
              access to the properties which whatever is being
              presented in the "theater" of the mind.


   [[ Hume ]]
      The strict empiricist
      his motto:
         -"no impression, no idea"
      in other words, our ideas are emptyy  or
        imaginary unless they are based on actual
        experiences or impressions from the senses.
      be careful in assuming that our ideas name real
        things.
         (think of obvious mistakes like attributing a
           cause when there was only coincidence: since I
           wore this hat my favorite team won, therefore
           wearing the hat made the team win. Hume's rule
           says: dont believe in something unless you
           really experienced it-in this case, the >real
           connection< between the events involved.)
      We have the habit of grouping our impressions to
        form our ideas. the grouping techniques are:

         -resemblance
         -Contiguity
         -Cause and effect
      This habit leads us to believe in the identity
        over time of various substances.
         -E.g., that is the same chair that was here
           yesterday
         -strictly speaking, I can only say,, the
           impressions I have today >resemble< the
           impressions I had yesterday.
         -i cannot see (or sense) its underlying
           substance, only its changing properties.


      What about the self?
         -Be an empiricist and think about your
           experience: notice the multitude of fleeting
           impressions.
            -"I never catch myself at any time without a
              perception, and never obseve any thing but
              the perception."
   [[ Kant ]]
      concepts without sensations are empty;
         reading a tour guide
      Sensations without concepts are blind.
         traveling with no background knowledge.
      (first rationalist, second empiricist
      rationalist
         critique of rationalists' ideas:
            productis of the imagination that need to
              apply to some object of experience in order
              for them to have meaning
         the self as a substance-is it just imaginary?
      empiricist
         .... refer to powerpoint

      Hume is right (about one thing)
         our ideas do not (and cannot) apply to any
           object of experience are "empty." That is, we
           can think about them, but we cannot say we
           know what they are (or what thy correspond to
           in reality , if anything).
            ie. round square
      For example, the totality of the universe (all
        space and all time).
      we can think this idea, but we can never know it(
        have cognition of it.
      it is a useful idea for organizing our experience
        of finie things, but it is beyond our cognitive
        capacity to know
      .. powerpoint

      However, we can't be strict empiricists:
         When we focus on our sensations (as
           empiricists encourage), we will notice that
           some mental contributions were necessary or
           required.
         its like watching a movie then noticing the
           set, the lighting, the sound, the
           choreography, etc.
         the "background" that gives an appearance
         these background requirements are the a priori
           contributions of the mind.
         ==?
         a priori=beforehand and necessary
         try to imagine space with nothing in it.
         try to imagine an object (eg, a table) that is
           not in space.
         if you cant do the latter, it shows us that
           the idea of space (or form of space) is
           required to be having sense experience of
           objects in the theater
            if you imagine a table, the would the table
              be in empty space (the mind)
         transcendental philosophy looks for these
           necessary features that make experience
           possible. and strict empiricism will not find
           them
      what about the self?
         notice that your experiences are >unified<:
            sights go together with sounds.
            all of them belong to me
            manifold experience.
            no matter what else they are, they are
              always experienced-by-me.
            the "I think" must accompany all my
              representations.
            thus a notion of the "self" in this sense
              is required even to be a strict empiricist

           contradiction
         conclude existence of god

      St. Anselm (1033-1109)
      ^^^^^^^^^^
         define god as "that than which nothing greater
           can be conceived"
            that is, te Greatest Concieved Being (GCB)
      Proof
         1)Suppose that the reatest concievable being
           (gcb) exists in the mind alone (and not in
           reality)
         2)Existence in reality is greater than existence
           in the mind alone
         3)We can concieve of this GCB existing in
           realiity as well as in the mind
         4)Therefore, we can concieve of a being that is
           greater than the GCB. (From 1,2, and 3)
              -that is saying greater than the greatest.
         5)But this is impossible for it is a
           contradiction.
         6)therefore, it is false that a gcb exists in
           the mind alone and not in realit. so a gcb
           must exist in reality as well as in the mind.
           this being is, by definition, god.
         7)ORDERED END

      Gaunilo's Objection:
         The same argument could show that the most
           perfect island must exist.
            that seems suspicious...
         what does the "greatest" mean?
            if "greatest" refers to a measurable
              quantity (such as "the highest mountain"
              then it is an empty concept
      anselm's reply
         true, but od's greatness is not measurable in
           this way
            god's goodness is not quantifiable in this
              sense

      Immanuel kant's (1781) objection:
         being or existence is not a property like
           "blue" or "heavy"
         we are asked to compare two items in anselm's
           proof:
            1. the gcb that exists in the mind but not
              reality
            2. the gcb that esists in the mind and in
              reality
            but what is that first one? is it a
              possible but non-existing being.
               it exists, yet does not exist
               this sounds like a paradox
            also, what about the second one? we are
              forced to suppose that god exists in
              reality in order  to evaluate this
              comparison, but that is Circular Reasoning

      argument
         1) God Exists
         2) if god exists, then god is omnipotent
         3) if something is omnipotent, it can do
           anything
         4) if god exists, then god can do anything (2,
           3)

         5) if god exists, then god is wholly good.
         6) if something is wholly good, it always
           eliminates as much evil as it can
         7) if god exists, then god eliminates as much
           evil as god can (5,6)
         8) if god exists, then god eliminates all evil
           (4,7)
         9) if god exists, then there is no evil (8)
         10) there is no evil (1, 9)
         11) Some evil exists
         Contradiction: There is evil and there is no
           evil (10,11)


      Logical Problem of Evil
         Discussionn of the argument:
         1) god exists and is omnipotent and wholly
           good
         2) evil exists
         is there a third statement that is necessarily
           true to amake (1) and (2) explicitly
           contradictory?
         8) god will prevent all evil
         necessarily true?
            no, what if the evil is required to bring
              about a greater or outweighing good?
         8a) god will prevent the occurrence of any
           evil that is not required to bring about a
           greater good.
         necessarily true?

--[Faith and Reason]--
[Unit 7]
   {{ pascal, clifford, and james }}

   Enlightnment assumption:
      all beliefs should be judged in the court of
        reason ad deemed acceptable only if they are
        supported by reason or evidence
         john lock on religion: "whatever god hath
           revealed, is certainly true:...but whether it
           be a revelation or no, reason must judge."
           "reason must be our last guide and judge in
           everything"
   however, Genuine religious belief seems to be based
     on faith, i,e.,
      -it is freely decided
      -      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      -it involves unconditional acceptance
      -            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   -Conundrum: if reason and evidence were the basis of
     religious belief,
      -Either the belief would be provablebeyond
        question--no room for free decision
      -Or the belief would be merely probable--no way
        for unconditional acceptance


   [Two types of rational beliefs]
      [Epistemic rationality]
         A's belief that P is epistemically rational
           iff A has (good) evidence for thinking P true
            rational belief=good evidence and reason
      [Pragmatic rationality]
         A's belief that P is pragmatically rational
           iff believing P is beneficial for A
            rational belief = "useful-to-believe"
              beliefs
            ie: arriving early is beneficial
            good thinking, "I know I am going to do
              well in the class"
               no reason or evidence, just belief
   Can pragmatic rationality help solve the conundrum?
      by challenging the enlightenment assumption
   New Conundrum: are the two types of rationality ever
     at odds with one another? that is, can a belief be
     rational in one sense but not in the other?



   [Pascal]
      Pascals wager
         god exists:
            belief: +infinity
            nonbelief: -infinity
         god does not exist:
            belief: small loss
            nonbelief: small gain
      Sources of belief:
         Reason
            1) Body (senses): exemlars--athletes and
              kings
            2) mind (reason): exemplars--scientists and
              philosophers
         Passion
            3) Heart(passion/feeling/desire/love/intuit
              ion): exemplars--religious prophets and
              mystics
      Pascal's challenge to enlightenment thought:
         we should permit the heart to shape our
           beliefs; do not trust reason to be sufficient.


   [Clifford]
      williams k. clifford--"the ethics of belief"
         "Is it wrong to always, everywhere, and for
           everyone, to believe anything upon
           insufficient evidence." (e.g., ship-owner
           negligence)
         why?
            (constructing false reality based upon a
              lie)
            what the ship owner did was morally wrong,
              even if the ship did make it.
            doing something subtle is thought to be the
              cause to something else larger, creating a
              belief.
               believing without good evidence
            ie: superstitions, luck, witch burning
            note: being rational is a matter of ethics,
              how one ought to think and form beliefs.
            without that habit, our credulity could
              lead us back to superstition and magic
            bad habits can be "contageous"
      thus, two enlightenment rules for belief
        formation:
         1) never overrule reason or evidence just
           because passion urges it.
         2) remain neutral if reason or evidence is
           absent or inconclusive
      by these rules, theism or atheism (assuming
        reason and evidence) should be agnostic


   [William James]
      agrees with clifford's rule 1:
         we should not believe something if reason or
           evidence shows otherwise, just because of our
           passions, whishes, desires, iinterests,
           preferences, etc.
      disagrees with clifford's rule 2:
         we have the right to believe something if
           there is no evidence either way and if the
           decision is a genuin option, ie: living,
           momentous, forced

            living (vs dead)
            momentous
               1) irreversible
               2) important
            Forced
               must make a choice
            why fear of error is more dominant over us
              than the quest for truth?

   -[Kierkegaard]
      -Object and Subject

      -Object (thing outside of the subject that is
        known or believed)
         -can the object of faith (God or whatever is
           deeped sacred or holy) be known with
           "objective certainty"?
         -folly of proof: begging the question
         -Ideal interpretation-ambiguity of evidence
            -is it or not?
            -will it be or not?
            [[ Remember the evidential problem of evil ]]
      -Subject (knower, believer, one who is committed)
         -think of pascal and w. james:
            -in absence of certain knowledge about
              ultimate matters, we can live with doubt
              that is either indifferent or filled with
              desire.
            -e.g., I doubt I'll ever be as good a person
              as _______, so who cares.
            -vs. I doubt I'll ever be as good a person
              as _______, but I hope I will be.
         -Leap to Faith as a doubt with desire
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

            -"Subjective truth" as authenticity and
              continual commitment

         -Can the subject be an object? Can "subjective
           truth" be turned into "objective truth"?
            -think of the suubject as an unfinished
              product-always on the make. One's
              commitments can never be guaranteed or
              simply finished and permanent.

      [[ By the way, this pattern describes all human activity: externalization, alienation, reinternalization ]]         -can think about all activities in this way
      -Why will that(reinternalization) happen?
         -We overcome our [false consciousness] by
           coming to see ourselves as the source of
           religious images. Divinity is, after all,
           >Within Us< rather than "out there." thus his
           religion is >>Humanist<<
         -[Humanist]
            -seeing ourselves as source of religion
              rather than praise or worship a

         -breath of empty space
         -become colder
         -night continually closing in on us

         -Think of "religion" as "being at home." This
           is >homelessness<. (The universe seems darker,
           colder, infinity, indifferent to us,
           purposeless, amoral, etc.)

   -[Aristotle]:
      -[Virtue Ethics]
         -What is a human being? (anthropos)
            -the "rational animal" (zoon echon logan)
            -(animal having word)
         -All human activity is directed towards...
            -Some Good or Other
         -The word for the highest good of human life
           is...

               -we fail to be efficient, may lose
                 pleasure

               -achieving the highest good
            -Eudaimonia is...

                  -intrinsic
                  -Instrumental

                 involves an activity or function
               -?
                  -if it were to only be a feeling, then
                    it would not be a life worth of
                    living, doing nothing at all
                  -therefore it is an activity or
                    function, as they bring you to that
                    eudaimonia or happiness
            -Virtue (arete) as a fulfillment of function
              to achieve an end.

                  -"Second Nature"
                     -when a habit becomes so engrained
                       into a person, that habit becomes
                       part of the character overall
                     -ie: military training-react to
                       certain situations in certain ways

      -[Cardinal Virtues]
         -1) Prudence
            -also known as practical wisdom, is the most
              important virtue for aristotle
            -We need this wisdom to make good judgements
              in uncertain conditions. It is the skill
              and habit of choosing the right eans to
              achieve a worthy end.
            -note that ethical life is not simply
              "following rules" or some kind
            -good judgements that are context dependent
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         -2) Temperance
            -Self control
            -moderation
            -a good life requires one  to master ones
              passions and be moderate in the use of
              pleasurable things.
         -3) Justice
            -Fairness
            -it requires recognizing what is good for
              the community and respecting the rights of
              each member of it
         -4) Courage
            -"Moderation or abservance of the mean with
              respect to fellings of fear and confidence"
            -a good life must confront our fears in the
              right way

         -Virtue as mean between extremes
            -eg. courage as a mean between cowardice and
              rash violence

            -frequency, degree, duration, people,
              provoking circumstances
            -other examples: enjoying life;being
              generous; having self-esteem


   -[Bentham]

         -refers to consequence of action

         -making choices based on consequence of action

         -Psychological Hedonism
            -Humans are motivated excusively by the
              wishes to experience pleasure and to avoid
              pain

         -Utility
            -Pleasure (happiness) or the avoidance of

            -Act so as to produce the greatest happiness
              in the greatest number.


            -Problem: Incommensurability of values
               -comparing items of different values
               -like eating something vs watching a
                 movie
               -Money a sort of way of setting values
               -apples to oranges, gallons of  milk to
                 movie tickets
               -how can we compare one form of utility
                 to another?


            -Factors to measure in determining utility

            [[ Simple Hedonic Calculus (table) ]]

            -the CPI
               -consumer price index
               -uses "hedonic quality adjustments" to
                 account for changes in products

--[Kant and Korsgaard]--
[Unit 10]

   [Deontological Ethics]
      -What makes an act right?
         -Consequensialist answer: the consequences
           or result of the act
            -Outcomes such as pleasure or happiness
              (or eudaimonia
         -Deontological answer: the act is right if
           it is...
            -1) a duty prescribed by the moral law
                  ^^^^

            -2) done with a good will (good intention)
                            ^^^^^^^^^

            -3) disinterestedly, no matter consequence
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

               -try to put on a "Veil of Ignorance" to
                 ignore personal interests and take the
                 community view

      -Moral Truth-necessary
         -Not contingent
            -Not dependent on human nature and desire
               -(vs. Hume)
            -Not dependent on instrumental value, that
              it secures non-moral goods such as pleasure
              or happiness (vs. aristotle, hobbes,
              bentham, mill)

      -Examples
         -shopkeepers
            -first doesnt b/c it is bad for business
            -second doesnt cheat because of sympathy for
              others
            -third doesnt cheat because it is wrong
            -Lesson: Motive or intention matters (the
              [ground] of your actions)
            --_>
               -the outcome is the same, but the
                 important part is the motive, doing it
                 purposely or doing it accidentally
               -this is absent in the consequentialist
                 view


         -Murder Story
            -Very similar to skyrim theif and hunter
              encounters: friend asks to hide from
              murderer and hides in basement
            -then murderer comes and asks about said
              friend
            -lie to murderer, possibly saving friend
            -tell murderer truth, letting friend die
            -Lesson: What lies in our hands is good
              intention itself.
               -Be mature: accept your limits.
                ^^^^^^^^^

      -What about conflicts of duties?
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

         -consider conflict between:
            -L: Do not lie
            -P: Always protect innocent life
            -since both are true but incompatible, we
              must choose which is more important in a
              given situation. (choose the [Prima Facie]
              duty or all-things-considered duty)
   [Categorical Imperative, Parts I, II, & III]

      [I. Universalization]
         -act only on that maxim whereby you can at the
           same time will that it would become a
           universal law
            -i.e., an action is moral iff you can make
              your reason for acting into a rule that
              everyone can follow.
               -failures of universalization:
                  -e.g., "a lying promise"
         -Main point: do not count yourself as special
           or exceptional. when you do, you know you're
           being inconsistent.

      [II. Principle of ends]
         -treat others (and oneself) always as an end
           and never merely as a means.
            -main point: do not expoit, manipulate,
              abuse people because people have dignity
              and intrinsic value.
         -question
            -does kant neglect other sources of value -
              animals, children, alzheimer patients,
              etc.?

      [III. Principle of autonomy]
         -every rational being is able to regard herself
           as a maker of universal law; that is, one does
           not need an external authority, be it God, the
           state, one's culture, or anyone else, to
           determine the nature of the moral law.
            -Main Point: moral laws can be known by us
              and will only be legitimate if they are
              self-legislated rather than imposed. you
              aren't being moral unless you are self-
              legislating
         -Heteronomy - rule by another
            -herd mentality (milgram shock experiment,
              stanford prison experiment)
            -instincts and desires ("external" drives) -
              alwyas empirical
         -Main Point: actions are moral only if the
           subject has reasons for acting and counts
           those reasons as the ground of action


         -sort of making sure you are not being pushed
           around or pushing others around


   [Background on Christine Korsgaard]
      -Veneer Theory
         -human nature as inherently sinful and
           "animalistic"
         -Opposed by Frans de Waal and Christine
           Korsgaard

         -frans de waal's russian doll model
            -(PAM = perception-action mechanism)
   [Christine Korsgaard]
      -Critique of "Pure Self-Interest"
         -most people still have sympathy for family or
           friends
      -Humans and nonhuman animals: how much is morality
        a break with our animal past?
         -continuities
         -discontinuuities
      -Lower Scale
         -plants
         -heart
         -causal process
         -like machine
      -Middle Scale
         -PAM (perception-action mechanism)
         -spider
         -fish
         -autopilot
      -Higher Scale
         -Cognitive awareness of self and its purposes
           or ends
         -now motive or intention is explicityly
           involved
         -and so Autonomy is possible
                 ^^^^^^^^

         -Second order desires and evalueations are
           possible
            -I find myself wanting X, but is wanting X a
              good reason to act? (I am aware of my
              desire as the ground of action and can
              evaluate it)


      -Cause -> Reason -> Ground of reasons

--[Kierkegaard]--
   [The Crowd]
      -abstractions are not specific
      -Abstraction
      -Untruth
      -Problem of conformity
      -Abdication of responsibility
         -am I making my decisions or are others making
           them for me

   [The Singular Individual]
      -more than abstract labels or roles
      -The Locus of responsibility
         -not like the patterns that we follow everyday
         -more of what is "my decision", not just what
           we are supposed to do.

   [Authenticity]
      -The "Prize"
      -A paradox and a challenge: "to be yourself"
         -it is a challenge because society can
           influence us, there is a pressure to conform
         -like telling a chair to be a chair, that is
           easy. for humans it is more difficult because
           humans have the ability to shape themselves,
           make decisions, use logic, create and develop,
           etc..
         -To be a human is to exist, to change, to
           choose, to become, to be free
         -we are sculptors, creators
