   What to Produce
   How to Produce
   For Whom to Produce

   What to produce
      Want to produce most valuable combination of
        goods and service
         Allocated Efficiency

   How to Produce
      Want to produce in least cost way
         dont use any more scarce resources than needed
         Technical Efficiency

   For Whom to Produce
      Want to be fair



   What to produce:
      Opporitunity cost
         what we must give up or sacrifice to get
           something
         Value of next-best alternative

         making choice of what to spend
         choosing what to do with time for example

            when graphed, the line created of the
              combinations is known as:
               Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)
                  Shows combinations of goods and
                    servces that can possibly be
                    produced... If all resources are used
                    efficiently
                  The PPC shows the maximium possible
                    combinations withh the given
                    resources. possibilities are either
                    on the curve or below the curve




                  Factors that can cause PPC to shift
                     1)Change in Number of Resources
                        increase or decrease in
                          resources
                     2)Change in Technology
                        technology can increase
                          productivity, reduce labor, and
                          improve efficiency

--[Trade]--

   america imports/exporting internationally is only
     about 15%
   ^^of trade
   distance is important in terms of trading
   canada, china, mexico are the biggest trading
     nations that america uses

    trading doesnt eliminate jobs, it allocates jobs    for example, textile mills in south carolina were
     shut down because other countries had a comparative
     advantage in textiles.
      the workers that would be allocated would not
        have the training or would not like to leave the
        location that they are...
      *Trade helps the country more than the worker.

   Specialize in what we have comparative advantage in.



-international trade is a bad thing because it is taking
  all jobs
   -Disagree...
   -International trade is important because other
     nations can do some things for cheaper. if a person
     loses their job because of international trade and
     refuses to allocate to a new job that would be a
     waste in terms of the nation.
   -Without trading with other nations, we would need to
     have all production within the nation, which may
     take up more space and resources than we have.
      -if nation A were to have a little, limited amount
        of resources of all types, they may be able to be
        self sufficent. while nation B has more of a
        certain type that nation A would run out of.
        would it not be beneficial to trade with nation
        b?
   -With international trade, it allows a more of a
     distribution to large resources. though it may
     allocate jobs for the individual, it benefits the
     greater good of the nation.


prices determine the what, how, and for whom to produce

If Country's Currency appreciates, it will import more
  and export less
If Country's Currency Depreciates, it will import less
  and export more
What causes D or S of currency curves to shift
   1)Change in relative percieved value of goods in
     different countries
   2)Change in relative prices in different countries
   3)Change in relative incomes
   4)Change in relative interest rates

      -Be smarter than the experts

      -Get Lucky
   Things that a stock counsilor/advisor may tell you

         -dont put all your eggs in one basket
      -Mutual fund
         -buys shares of multiple different companies

      stock prices are not always predictable, they can
        be totally random. I think that the stock market
        is in a lot of ways like gambling, sometimes you
        win, sometimes you lose, but those who cheat
        (inside information) will usually win but it is
        illegal to do so.

      Only unknown information can change the market

--[Fairness]--
   Inequality has increased between the rich (top 20%)
     and poor(lower 80%) in income for households
   technology may be the leading reason for
     inequality..


   Skill-Based Technological Change
      technology can have different effects on people
        with different skill levels
      technology of robots in factories have been
        taking away jobs from the lower skilled/lower
        class workers

   Winner-Take-All Markets
      The small differences in ability creates very
        large differences in pay
         think of this like olympic medal winners.
           silver medal winner may be only a fraction of
           a second slower, but the gold medalist is the
           one who will be noticed and remembered.
         the top of the line of some markets are paid
           much more than those who come in second
      instead of local markets, because of technology
        of past ~40 years, said local markets can become
        global markets, but that would make other local
        markets go down.....
      internet was one of the biggest changes in
        technology that altered markets.

   Explain why winner take all markets have become
     increasingly important as a result of technological
     changes
      With technological advancements in things such as
        communication and advanced transportation, winner
        take all markets have the potential to grow from
        the local markets to a wider and more easily
        accessible global market.
      these global markets give the "winner" the
        potential to grow on an international level.

   relative and absolute success.
      absolute would be earning $50
      relative would be earning $50, but everyone else
        gets $500
   relative ability is usually more important than
     absolute ability.. most of the time
   incentives are important, redistribution can easily
     change the incentives of both the top and bottom

            the time that was available because of the
            time saved from technology

         you would want to buy more. the same thing is
         applied to >medical care<

   1)Fee-For-Services Payment System
        -paying more than what it really needs. people
         who lie about services needed.
        -ie. doctors who say you need thousands of
         dollars of surgery when it is a minor problem or
         no problem at all. selling services that are not
         necessary.
        -since they have more knowledge about it, we put
         more trust into them, and they have the ability
         to manipulate us
   2)HELP
        -this is seen more in a free market (like
         america)
   3)High Administrative Costs
        -the first thing you go to the doctor, they ask
         about your insurance.
        -~25% of medical costs go to administrative in
         america
