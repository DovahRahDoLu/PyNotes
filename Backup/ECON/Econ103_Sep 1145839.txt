3 Basic Allocation Questions
   What to Produce
   How to Produce
   For Whom to Produce

   What to produce
      Want to produce most valuable combination of
        goods and service
         Allocated Efficiency

   How to Produce
      Want to produce in least cost way
         dont use any more scarce resources than needed
         Technical Efficiency

   For Whom to Produce
      Want to be fair



   What to produce:
      Opporitunity cost
         what we must give up or sacrifice to get
           something
         Value of next-best alternative

         making choice of what to spend
         choosing what to do with time for example
                                  1 hour
            read economics         30 pp
            play racquetball      3 games

            opporitunity cost of 30 pp of econ = 3
              games of racquetball
            opporitunity cost of 1 page of econ = 1/10
              game of racquetball



            8 hours

            8 hrs          econ pp            games
                             240                0
                              0                 24
                             120                12

            when graphed, the line created of the
              combinations is known as:
               Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)
                  Shows combinations of goods and
                    servces that can possibly be
                    produced... If all resources are used
                    efficiently
                  The PPC shows the maximium possible
                    combinations withh the given
                    resources. possibilities are either
                    on the curve or below the curve




                  Factors that can cause PPC to shift
                     1)Change in Number of Resources
                        increase or decrease in
                          resources
                     2)Change in Technology
                        technology can increase
                          productivity, reduce labor, and
                          improve efficiency

specialization increases our production of goods and
  services


--[Specialization]--

                     good x            good y

   annie             10 units          30 units

   lawrie            8 units           40 units


   annie has abolute advantage in x
   lawrie has absolute advantage in y

   opporitunity cost of producing 1 x
      annie       3y
      lawrie      5y

   Opporitunity cost of producing 1 y
      annie       1/3x
      lawrie      1/5x

   annie is low cost producer of x
   lawrie is low cost producer of y

   By herself Annie could get 3y for an x... To benefit
     from specialization and trade she would want to get
     more than 3y for an x
   By herself Lawrie must give up 5y to get an x... She
     can benefit from specialization and trade.. if she
     can get an x for less than 5y

   1x = 4y would benefit both
      annie wanted more than 3y for an x
         annie gets 4y instead
      lawrie wanted an x for less than 5y
         lawrie gets an x for 4y instead




   example 2

                      Good x         good y

      annie           5 units        25 units
      laurie          10 units       30 units

      laurie has the absolute advantage in X AND Y

      annie has 1:5
      laurie has 1:3

       The ratios are important 

      The opp. cost of 1x
         annie     5y
         laurie    3y

            annie laurie is the low cost producer of x
      The opp. cost of 1y
         annie    1/5x
         laurie   1/3x
            annie is the low cost producer of y

      !!!
      Comparitive Advantage
         Goes to person with lower opporitunity cost
      Opporitunity cost:  1x=4y
      annie gains by getting 1x for 4y instead of 5y
      laurie gains by getting 4y instead of 3y for an x


   example 3

                         good x           good y

      shakira           50 units          10 units
      adele             40 units          5 units

         1) calculate opporitunity cost for x and y for
           each
         2) identify comparative advantage
         3) identify mutually beneficial trade ratio
         4) explain how that ratio benefits each

         1) opp costs
            1x
               shakira    1/5y
               adele      1/8y
            1y
               shakira    5x
               adele      8x

            shakira is low cost producer of y
            adele   is low cost producer of x

         shakira has absolute advantage

         beneficial trade ratio:   6.5x = 1y

         shakira would gain 6.5x per 1y instead of 5x
           per 1y
         adele would gain 1y for 6.5x instead of 8x


      The Mutually beneficial cost can be ANYTHING
        between the two costs

--[Trade]--

   america imports/exporting internationally is only
     about 15%
   ^^of trade
   distance is important in terms of trading
   canada, china, mexico are the biggest trading
     nations that america uses

    trading doesnt eliminate jobs, it allocates jobs    for example, textile mills in south carolina were
     shut down because other countries had a comparative
     advantage in textiles.
      the workers that would be allocated would not
        have the training or would not like to leave the
        location that they are...
      *Trade helps the country more than the worker.

   Specialize in what we have comparative advantage in.



-international trade is a bad thing because it is taking
  all jobs
   -Disagree...
   -International trade is important because other
     nations can do some things for cheaper. if a person
     loses their job because of international trade and
     refuses to allocate to a new job that would be a
     waste in terms of the nation.
   -Without trading with other nations, we would need to
     have all production within the nation, which may
     take up more space and resources than we have.
      -if nation A were to have a little, limited amount
        of resources of all types, they may be able to be
        self sufficent. while nation B has more of a
        certain type that nation A would run out of.
        would it not be beneficial to trade with nation
        b?
   -With international trade, it allows a more of a
     distribution to large resources. though it may
     allocate jobs for the individual, it benefits the
     greater good of the nation.


prices determine the what, how, and for whom to produce



--[Demand]--

   Demand: Willingness to Buy

   Depends upon:
      Price of product
      Percieved Value
      Price of Complements
         (not compliments)
         car and gas
         charger and phone
         etc.
      Price of Substitutes
         android/iphone
         coke/pepsi
      Income
      Expectations
         expecting prices to be higher or lower
            a new game cost $60 while a year later may
              only be $30

      # of potential consumers/buyers
