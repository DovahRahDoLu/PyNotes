   What to Produce
   How to Produce
   For Whom to Produce

   What to produce
      Want to produce most valuable combination of
        goods and service
         Allocated Efficiency

   How to Produce
      Want to produce in least cost way
         dont use any more scarce resources than needed
         Technical Efficiency

   For Whom to Produce
      Want to be fair



   What to produce:
      Opporitunity cost
         what we must give up or sacrifice to get
           something
         Value of next-best alternative

         making choice of what to spend
         choosing what to do with time for example

            when graphed, the line created of the
              combinations is known as:
               Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)
                  Shows combinations of goods and
                    servces that can possibly be
                    produced... If all resources are used
                    efficiently
                  The PPC shows the maximium possible
                    combinations withh the given
                    resources. possibilities are either
                    on the curve or below the curve




                  Factors that can cause PPC to shift
                     1)Change in Number of Resources
                        increase or decrease in
                          resources
                     2)Change in Technology
                        technology can increase
                          productivity, reduce labor, and
                          improve efficiency

--[Trade]--

   america imports/exporting internationally is only
     about 15%
   ^^of trade
   distance is important in terms of trading
   canada, china, mexico are the biggest trading
     nations that america uses

    trading doesnt eliminate jobs, it allocates jobs    for example, textile mills in south carolina were
     shut down because other countries had a comparative
     advantage in textiles.
      the workers that would be allocated would not
        have the training or would not like to leave the
        location that they are...
      *Trade helps the country more than the worker.

   Specialize in what we have comparative advantage in.



-international trade is a bad thing because it is taking
  all jobs
   -Disagree...
   -International trade is important because other
     nations can do some things for cheaper. if a person
     loses their job because of international trade and
     refuses to allocate to a new job that would be a
     waste in terms of the nation.
   -Without trading with other nations, we would need to
     have all production within the nation, which may
     take up more space and resources than we have.
      -if nation A were to have a little, limited amount
        of resources of all types, they may be able to be
        self sufficent. while nation B has more of a
        certain type that nation A would run out of.
        would it not be beneficial to trade with nation
        b?
   -With international trade, it allows a more of a
     distribution to large resources. though it may
     allocate jobs for the individual, it benefits the
     greater good of the nation.


prices determine the what, how, and for whom to produce

If Country's Currency appreciates, it will import more
  and export less
If Country's Currency Depreciates, it will import less
  and export more
What causes D or S of currency curves to shift
   1)Change in relative percieved value of goods in
     different countries
   2)Change in relative prices in different countries
   3)Change in relative incomes
   4)Change in relative interest rates

      -Be smarter than the experts

      -Get Lucky
   Things that a stock counsilor/advisor may tell you

         -dont put all your eggs in one basket
      -Mutual fund
         -buys shares of multiple different companies

        illegal to do so.

      Only unknown information can change the market
        (because the experts push the price to what they
        think it should be

   subprime
      cut loans to make it affordable
   compared the housing market to bubbles, they rose,
     then fell and popped
   IMAGE: HOUSING2006
      since values fell, people owed more on loans than
        they had for house

   Negative Equity-
      -Owe more on asset then asset is worth
   15-20% of homeowners had negative equity at this
     time
   this also put the people who could build houses out
     of business because no one would be buying houses

   this created a snowball effect, because no one was
     buying, and people were getting laid off left and
     right
   when the housing market collapsed, it took everyone
     with it

   May 2007:    4.4% unemployment rate
   Oct 2009:     10% unemployment rate
   middle of 2008, united states economy was on the
     brink of collapse, almost another great depression

   Leverage
      -Buying assets with borrowed funds
      asset p=$100
         rises 10%
         10% profit

         falls 10%
         10% loss

      borrow 90, use 10 of own
         if p rises to 110
            not 10%, but 100% profit
            because paid back 90, then have 20 left
         if p falls to 90
            100% price loss

      this is what was happening to the us financial

Should we produce more units of a good?
   yes, if those units create more value than we could
     get from alternative goods
   OR IF THE BENEFIT OR VALUE WE GET EXCEEDS THE
     OPPORTUNITY COst

Marginal benefit (MB) = additional benefi we get from
  one more unit of a good
Marginal Cost (MC) = additional cost incurred by
  producing one more unit of a good
For allocated efficiency we should keep producing more
  units as long as MB >= MC

   mc of sleeping one extra hr is  2, if what you give
     up (social media) is valued at 2
   MC of sleeping a second hr is 8, if what you give up
     (shower) is valued at 8
   marginal cost of every additional hour is whatever
     each hour is
      study economics = 6428

      mc of 5 extra hours is 6428


      sleeping in for 3 extra hours is 2 + 8 + 17

   allocated efficiency is equilibrium between MB & MC
