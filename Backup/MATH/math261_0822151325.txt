--[sets]--
   -set: well defined collection of items
      -Well defined: there can be no ambiguity as to
        whether a particular item belongs to the set or
        not.
   -example
      -set of all students enrolled in math 261001 for
        fall 2017
         -well defined
   -example
      -Set of all great guitarists.
         -great is subjective, not well defined

   -Integers
      -Z 
         -this is the character used to usually define
           integers
      -{...-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
      -(textbook denotes the positive integers with
        capital P


   -Rational Numbers
      -Q = numbers that can be represented as a fraction
        of two integers.
      -The decimal representation of a rational number
        will either terminate or repeat.


   -Irrational Numbers
      -Q^1 Real numbers that can't be represented as a
        fraction of two integers
      -Examples include pi, e, sqrt 2, sqrt 3


   -Real Numbers
      -R = all decimal numbers (the rational and
        irrational numbers together)



   -Every integer is a rational number
   -Every rational number is a real number
   -Every integer is a real number
   -Every irrational number is a real number


   -set  A is a proper subset of set B
      -if every element of set A is also an element of
        set B, but the sets are not equal C there's
        atleast one element of B that is not an element
        of A


   [Methods of writing a set]
      -1) Word descriptions
      -2) list notation/enumeration
         -{ comma separated list of items }
      -3) Set builder notation
         -{ x |  }
            -{
               -set
            -x
               -label for an arbitrary item in the set
            -|
               -such that
            -  
            -| }
               -criteria x must adhere to to be in the
                 set
         -example
            -Q = {p/q | pEZ and qEZ and q!= 0}

   -Example
      -{...,-1,0,1,2,3}
      -{x | xEZ and x <= 3}


   -Empty Set
      -{}
      -null set
      -0 with / through it

   -Cardinality
      -the number of unique items in a set
      -|s|
      -n(s)
      -unique items in s


{{ Order does not matter, Duplicates dont matter }}
-in terms of sets
