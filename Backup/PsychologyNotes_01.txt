*Biology And Behavior
*Modules 3 & 4
*Nervous system:
*>Neurons:
*>>Cell body
*>>dendrites(recieve info from other neurons)
*>>axon(long structure connected to cell body, sends
electrical currents)
*>>Myelin sheath(acts as insulator, increases speed of
pulses, on some neurons)
*>>terminal branches of axon(sends out signals)
*>Types of Neurons:
*>>3 types:
*>>1) sensory
*>>2) motor
*>>3) interneuron
*>>1) send signals to brain
*>>2) sends signals from brain to muscles
*>>3) connect between other neurons(only located in
brain and spinal column)
*>How they transmit info:
*>>action potential(sends info)
*>>occurs through electically charged ions
*>>>resting(abundance of positively charged ions)
*>>>active (abundance of negatively charged ions)
*>>produced when a signal is great enough to exceed the
threshold
*>>intensity
*>>>rate of firing
*>>>number of neurons firing
*>Neural Communication:
*>>Signals can be:
*>>>Excitatory(begin an action)
*>>>Inhibitory(stop doing something)
*Keeping things in balance= Homeostasis
*What happens when you touch a hot stove?
*>reflexive response to pain
*>directly at spinal cord
*>(reflex before swear)
*Neural Communication:
*>electrical imulses(action potentials) travel from one
neuron to another
*>Neurotransmitters are released when the action
potential reaches the axon terminal at the end of the
neuron
*>there is a small space at between terminal branch and
dendrites. this space is clalled the synaptic gap
*>they then cross the synaptic gam and open tiny
channels on the dendrites of recieving neuron.
*Reuptake
*>extra neurotransmitters get taken back to the axon
terminal
*Blocking Reuptake
*>Blocks reuptake of neurotransmitters into axon
terminal.
*Divisions of The Nervous System:
*>Nervous System
*>A) Peripheral
*>A1 Somatic(have control over)
*>A2 Autonomic(heart)
*>A2>>sympathetic
*>A2>>>activating, like stress, fight or flight response,
no logic, survival response.
*>A2>>parasympathetic, calming response
*>B) Central
*Central Nervous System:
*>Comprised of brain and spinal cord
*>ascending tracts send sensory information up to the
brain
*>Descending tracts send motor responses down through
the spinal cord
*Endocrine System
*>interconnected with the nervous system
*>secrete hormones as chemical messengers.
*>Brain>pituitary gland> other glands>hormones>brain

learning
*>>while awake, connections between neurons are
constantly changing
*>>>strengthening and weakening through active and
passive learning

that unnecessary inforation may be disarded and space

    +Gene
    +^order from cell to genes
+Chromosomes
  +humans have 23 pairs of chromosmes
  +The nucleus of every cell has an entire set of these
  46 chromosomes
      +except for the sec cells, which only contain half
    of the necessary 46
        +the combination of these two cells during
    conception provides us with all 46
        +Each parent provides 23 of them
+Differentiating between genes and environment

+Gender Development
+What impacts what it means to be either male of female
  +Nature or Nurture, or Both?
  +
  +Nature(biology))-
    +sense of being male of female
  +Nurture(environmental)-
    +how we express or interpret gender roles
+
+Genes and Gender
  +Sex chromosomes are what determine the sex of a child
    +two types: x and y
      +mother can be x
      +father can be x or y
  +First 7 weeks of fetal development, internal sex
  organs of male and female fetuses are identical.
    +gene on y  chromosome controls differentiation
    +if gonads develope into y, then they become
    testicals
      +
  +once internal sex organs have developed, hormones
  then impact gender developement
    +do so in two ways:
    +1. organizational effects--in utero
      +impacts the way the brain organizes
    +2. activational effects--in puberty
      +brings about primary and secondary sex
      characteristics associatied with puberty
          +<
+
+Sex hormones and Variation
+
  +May also play a role in variations in gender identity
  and sexual orientation
    +
  +Sexual orientation = who we are attracted to
  +gender identity = which gender we identify with
  +
  +similarly related to how hormones effect brain
  organization in utero
    +transgender individuals
    +biologically one sex but identify as the opposite
    gender
      +individuals with same-sex attraction

+
+Environment and Gender

  +gender roles- set of behavioral expectations for
  males and females
    +gender-typing- degree to which we take on traditional
  masculine of feminine roles
      +theories of gender-typing:
      +social learning theory
      +gender schema theory
+Social Learning Theory
  +Theory that children learn gender-linked behaviors
  by:
      +observation
    +differential reinforcement
  +Most children acquire a basic sense of gender
  identity by age 2.5
    +over attend to sex-stereotyped behaviors
+Gender Schema Theory
  +gender schema theory
  +(schema is way to simplify and frame info)
    +children construct schemas to organize beliefs and
    expectations about being male or female
        +construction of [in-group/out-group schema]
