         -if the speaker is clear and most of the
           audience was listening, but you dont ask

        before responding
      -prevents you from generalizing or evaluating too
        soon, before ou truely understand the data
      -will give you better ideas to write about
      -will inactivate your like/dislike-agree/disagree
        switch

   [rules]
      -1) annotate
         -slow down; resist gudgement
         -ask yourself these questions
            -what do I notice
            -what do I find most interesting
            -what do I find most strange
            -what do I find most revealing

            -find about 7 or so of them

      -3) Rank the details: which details or specific
        features of the subject are most interesting
        (strange, revealing, significant)?

      -4) explain why the top 3 details are interesting
        (strange, revealing, significant)
         -now that you see that something is strange,
           then you find it unique and you can write

--[Elements of Critical Thinking]--
   -why do we use these?
      -enables us to:
         -Examine others' ideas critically and
           objectively;
         -prevents autopilot
         -identify barriers, filters, impediments,
           piases, pov
         -think mindfully and demonstrate fair
           mindedness (vs. the above)
   -Noish focuses not on writing but on the Thinking
                                            ^^^^^^^^

   [Terms]
      -Reasons/Reasoning
         -describes the process of thinking
         -ie fallacies
      -Claims
         -theses based on your assumptions that you try
           to "Prove"
            -your not really trying to prove something,
              but you are more focused on supporting some
              idea
         -try to support that the claim is VALID
      -Arguments
         -assertions made theses and support
      -Hypotheses
         -Assumptions based on evidence and testing that
           you prove or disprove

      -Most of these terms are involved with a deductive
        or thesis-driven way of thinking---one that
        attempts to eliminate possibilities. initially,
        we're going to avoid inductive reasoning
   -thinking critically is messy, non-linear, and
     recursive

   -going around the circle (of elements)
      -start on any slice(but try to start on question
        at issue)
      -gets easier as you repeat it
      -often shows youwhich areas will be most
        productive to work with ( not always the ones
        where the answers come most easily
      -generates lots of raw material to draft from
        ---gives you luxury of selecting the best
