[Information Architecture]
   organizing, structuring, and labeling
   Understanding where things are
   what people find
   what is around the interface
   what to expect; what is there to do
      winthrop website: quick links has all of the
        links
      can be viewed as good or bad honestly

   Context, content, and users
   context
      business goals, funding, culture, tech, etc
   content
      document, data types, volume
   users
      audience, etc
   It's like a bridge builder

[User Experience]
   Making things work together seamlessly
   sometimes known as Customer Experience
      others say Experience Design
   meeting the needs of the customer that allows
     them to seamlessly achieve their goal
   process of creating products and meaningful
     experiences

   understand context of use ->
      specify user requirements ->
         design solutions ->
            evaluate against requirements

   example, different types of juicers
      some are easy to use, some are more effective,
        some are simply fun

   They Design Experiences
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   UX is like using the item or website
               ^^^^^


[User Interaction]
   How the user faces the system is User Interface
   how the system acts on the user is User
     Interaction
   Basically like anything a user might interact
     with
   History
      1970s
         Command Line Interface
      1980s
         first GUI was developed by Xerox PARC
         using icons
      1984

--[Methodologies]--

[Card Sorting]
   Open and closed card sorting
   [Open]
      organize topics from content within website
        into groups.
      create categories
      users group categories with content using
        terms or labels
   closed
      predefined categories, just organizing them
   categorization of the thoughts of the user
   language of the user
   discovering content and unknown
Prototyping
   research, production, preliminary, etc
   sort of a visual of the idea, that can be shown to
     others

   learn by making
      double check yourself
   learn by failing
      what didn't work
   design with users
      you translate the users need as they critique.
   pitch ideas
   share ideas
      multidisciplinary
      different viewpoints
   test ideas
   learn problem more
   find questions
      elaborate more questions
   find solutions
      better solutions


   [Rapid Prototyping]
      fast
      not clean
      for feedback purposes
           ^^^^^^^^

      should be rough
      it will go into review
      this will give you feedback
      then use the feedback for refining
      then Repeat the process

   [Paper Prototyping]
      Test potential problems
         simple tasks to do
      anticipate user
      make each action of the task
         catch all steps of the process
         usability

      because it is paper, you can ask a broader range
        of users to test it (like elderly)
      allow them draw things on the prototype
      gives them more power and easier use of the site
      ask what they remember, how they do things
         what they remember of the site

      Quotes
         adding actual quotes from users will help to
           ground the information in research as well as
           add realistic imporession
         do NOT just make them up  that smacks of your

     representative user
   identify any usability problems to collect
     qual/quant data determine the participants
     satisfaction with the product
   [Good Usability]

      speaking user's language
      minimize memory load
      support recal
      constructive error messages

      support recall
      shortcuts
      give feedback
      prevent errors

      how they complete a task
      how long it takes
      how satisfied are they
      identify changes
      analyze performance to know if it met your
        usability objectives
   [Why Usability Test]
      Usability issues
         all the things you typically find inn
           testing...
         confusing concepts
         poor terminology
         layout problems
         lack of feedback

        requirements
         needs that dev team is not aware of
         team may mistake assumptions
      Preference for one design alternative
         sometimes bias towards a specific design
      Priorities
         no company has unlimited resources - paper
           prototyping can sepearate got to haves from
           nice to haves
      issues outside the user interface
         product is more than User Interface
         brand and company's reputation are important,
           as well as the context in which the product
           will be used
         can uncover issues beyond the user interface
      don't make something look fancy if its actually
        cheap, that will confuse everyone
   [Benefits of Usability Testing]
      Good for interative design process
      can be small groups to get major problems
        discovered
      insight into the users' habits, approaches new
        ways of looking at the site

      Using a screener is important if you are not
        recruiting users yourself
      You can find people at the coffee shop but you
        must determine first if they are eligible
      ( pre-test: how often are they using/how adept

      to do this the evaluators go through each step in
        the task and provide a story about why that step
        is or is not good
      to do a walkthrough you need 4 things
         Specific document
            description of prototype of the system
            doesnt have to be complete, but should be
              fairly detailed
            such as location and wording for a menu can

         Tasks
            description of the task the user is to

      given this information, the evaluators step
        thorugh the action sequence (actions) to critique
        the system and tell a believable story about its
        usability

      a) will user be trying to produce action
      b) will user be able to notice correct action
      c) once user find correct action, will they know
        it is the right one for the effect

            support undo and redo
         4) Consistency and Standards
            Users should not have to wonder whether

              same thing
            follow platform conventions
         5) Error Prevention
            even better than good error messages is
              careful design with proevents problem from
              occuring in the first place
            ie: present users with a confirmation
              option
         6) Recognition rather than recal
            minimize users memory load by making
              objects, actions, and options visible
            the user should not have to remember
              information from one part of the dialogue
              to another
            instructions for user of the system should
              be visible or easily retrievable whenever

         7) Flexibility and efficiency of use
            Accelerators - unseen by novice user - may
              often speed up the interaction for both the
              expert user such that they system can cater
              to both inexperienced and experienced users
            allows users to tailor frequent actions
            EXAMPLE
               Undo, cut/copy/paste, indent/dedent
                 shortcuts
         8) Aesthetic and minimalist Design
            Dialogue should not contain information
              which is irrelevant or rarely needed
            every extra unit of information  in a
              dialogue competes with the revelant units
              of information and diminishes their
              relative visibility
         9) Help users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover
           from Errors
            Error messages should be expressed in plain
              language (no code), precisely indicate the
              problem, and constructively suggest a
              solution
            EXAMPLE
               Constructive 404 error page, tell user
                 what happened and what they can do next
         10) Help and documentation
            Even though it is better if the system can
              be used without documentation, it may be
              necessary to provide help and documentation
            any such information should be easy to
              search, focused on the users task, list
              concrete steps to be carried out and not be
              too large
