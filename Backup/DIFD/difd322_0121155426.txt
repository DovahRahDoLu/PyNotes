[Information Architecture]
   organizing, structuring, and labeling
   Understanding where things are
   what people find
   what is around the interface
   what to expect; what is there to do
      winthrop website: quick links has all of the

   Context, content, and users
   context
      business goals, funding, culture, tech, etc
   content
      document, data types, volume
   users
      audience, etc
   It's like a bridge builder

[User Experience]
   Making things work together seamlessly
   sometimes known as Customer Experience
      others say Experience Design
   meeting the needs of the customer that allows
     them to seamlessly achieve their goal
   process of creating products and meaningful
     experiences

   understand context of use ->
      specify user requirements ->
         design solutions ->
            evaluate against requirements

   example, different types of juicers
      some are easy to use, some are more effective,
        some are simply fun

   They Design Experiences
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   UX is like using the item or website
               ^^^^^


[User Interaction]
   How the user faces the system is User Interface
   how the system acts on the user is User
     Interaction
   Basically like anything a user might interact
     with
   History
      1970s
         Command Line Interface
      1980s
         first GUI was developed by Xerox PARC
         using icons
      1984

--[Methodologies]--

[Card Sorting]
   Open and closed card sorting
   [Open]
      organize topics from content within website
        into groups.
      create categories
      users group categories with content using
        terms or labels
   closed
      predefined categories, just organizing them
   categorization of the thoughts of the user
   language of the user
   discovering content and unknown
Prototyping
   research, production, preliminary, etc
   sort of a visual of the idea, that can be shown to
     others

   learn by making
      double check yourself
   learn by failing
      what didn't work
   design with users
      you translate the users need as they critique.
   pitch ideas
   share ideas
      multidisciplinary
      different viewpoints
   test ideas
   learn problem more
   find questions
      elaborate more questions
   find solutions
      better solutions


   [Rapid Prototyping]
      fast
      not clean
      for feedback purposes
           ^^^^^^^^

      should be rough
      it will go into review
      this will give you feedback
      then use the feedback for refining
      then Repeat the process
