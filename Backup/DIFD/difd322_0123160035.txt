      predefined categories, just organizing them
   categorization of the thoughts of the user
   language of the user
   discovering content and unknown
Prototyping
   research, production, preliminary, etc
   sort of a visual of the idea, that can be shown to
     others

   learn by making
      double check yourself
   learn by failing
      what didn't work
   design with users
      you translate the users need as they critique.
   pitch ideas
   share ideas
      multidisciplinary
      different viewpoints
   test ideas
   learn problem more
   find questions
      elaborate more questions
   find solutions
      better solutions


   [Rapid Prototyping]
      fast
      not clean
      for feedback purposes
           ^^^^^^^^

      should be rough
      it will go into review
      this will give you feedback
      then use the feedback for refining
      then Repeat the process

   [Paper Prototyping]
      Test potential problems
         simple tasks to do
      anticipate user
      make each action of the task
         catch all steps of the process
         usability

      because it is paper, you can ask a broader range
        of users to test it (like elderly)
      allow them draw things on the prototype
      gives them more power and easier use of the site
      ask what they remember, how they do things
