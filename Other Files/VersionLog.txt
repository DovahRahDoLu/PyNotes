10.12.2015
there are now a few PyApps, as I will start calling them
  this includes PyNotes, PySlides, and PyOutline
  
  PyNotes:
    for note taking


  PySlides:
    for making slideshows

  PyOutline:
    for making an outline
    this was originally meant to be implemented into pynotes,
    then created as a new program entirely
