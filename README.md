# Description
This is a program to take notes and save them

# Notes
Update main program to appropriately reflect class schedule

# DISCLAIMER
This program has not been modified nor implemented yet for public distribution. In its current version, most everything is hard coded. Later into the future the program will be released as a full open-source program available for individual use.
[edit]
yes it has been a few years since I've made this, and development has slowed. Hopefully by the end of this year I'll be able to publish a public distribution version.
