Purpose
	Taking the data of the temperature of the world may give us different
	 answers about global warming
	To discuss the methods for measuring earth's temperature

Question at Issue
	What is the source of global warming, if not primarily greenhouse
	 gases?
	What can we do with this data in relation to global warming?
	What does this information mean?
	
	how accurate are our means of measuring temperature over millenia?
	does global warming exist?
Assumptions
	Greenhouse Gases are not the primary cause of global warming
	//most of this is raw factual data
Implications and Consequenses
	Using tree rings is not the best method in determining temperature
	 because it can only be used for decades rather than annual
Information
	Many proxies to measure the temperature of earth
	majority of tree data comes from mid to high latitude zones
Concepts
	Climate/global warming
	Temperatures
	Accuracy
	Proxy Data
		not direct measurement
		>Substitutes< (ie for thermometer)
Conclusions
	Many methods are used to by climate scientists to determine the
	 cause of and past history of earth's climates
Point of View
	National Academy of Sciences
		- thermal borehole technique
		- dendroclimatology for decadal rather than annual
	Dendroclimatologists
		- study tree ring structure for climate
	Raney
		- Material Science PHD
		- Author
		- Different methods of collecting temperatures
	Mann
		- 1998 was hottest year in millenium
	Jones
		- Exceeded resolution of data is at best imprudent

Context







============================================
Standards Check
============================================

V Clear
	gave examples with thorough explanations
	lots of examples
V Accurate
	*deals with using evidence to make point
	scientific background and part of a think tank
V Important, Relevant
	mentions greenhouse gases and global warming, but not important
V Sufficient
	What does the information mean?
	does not elaborate on why it is important
	is there more to explain?
	*we have to trust because of his scientific background and published
V Deep and Broad
	breadth
		covered about 4 different methods for measuring temperatures
		think of breadth like point of view
			ie, using different stand points
	depth
		gave examples and how each method worked, along with flaws
		the depth is gray areas
			ie, flaws, strengths, complexities. not one or other
V Precise
	*deals with how specific you get in your reasoning
	1998 was hottest year
	0.04 degrees
	science wants precision
	
	Problematic
		uses .04 celsius and .1 celsius, why not use farenheight
V Reasonable Overall
