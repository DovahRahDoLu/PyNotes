	Technology
	Proficiency
	Inflation

	Jobs
	Knowledge
		we get information, but we earn knowledge, we learn it.
q@i
	is it the fault of the student for not doing as well?
	Are we preparing our students for future success?
assumptions
	  (teachers having too high expectations the students)
	Teachers believe that the grades help
		but it does not represent the learning of the students.
	  (parents giving false hope for students)
       *We can do anything    (We can Dream Big)
	Not all Jobs are Attainable / are white collar (or desired)
	  (teachers not teaching students how to learn, but what to learn)
	way leisure (technology) time is spent hinders academic progress
	  (grades are high, performance is low)
	Grades are not indicative of learning proficiency
information
	23% of high school students are proficient in math
	performance is down in honors classes
	government report on reading proficiency in high schools
	work force ill-prepared
	Memorization is necessary at times for learning
conclusions
	high school seniors are not as prepared for the work force because
	 they are not trained how to work, they are given knowledge.
