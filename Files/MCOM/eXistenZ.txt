   -the "games are bad" theme
      -you have the realists who say that the games are
        a negative impact on society, and therefore they
        do everything in their power to take out the
        designer of existenz
      -then the others who want to protect the creator
        of existenz, and they dont want the games to
        become nonexistant in their society.

      -A bit like how parents say that videogames are
        bad, and they are like a disease
         -diseased pod?
         -exaggeration on video games are bad

   -"you dont have a bioport?
      -everyone has a bioport, it is the societal norm
        in the movie

   -hyperreality theme:
      -at the end of the movie, the person who plays as
        the chinese restaurant owner, he asks:
         -"To tell you the truth, are we still in the
           game?"
      -this is like a cliffhanger as well, as it leaves
        the viewers with the question of are we really in
        reality
      -how will we know the difference
      -how will we know the difference between reality
        and the virtual world once we are inside?
