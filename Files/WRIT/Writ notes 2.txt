*Thesis
*>is an assertion about the content of the paper.
*>your topic becomes a thesis when you make a claim
about it

[Parenthetical Citations]
  +Parenthetical Citations:
    +used to allow the reader to quickly locate the
     source used in the text of the paper
  +Examples:
    +Good: 
      +Kate Chopin, author of <i>The Awakening</i>,
       writes, "She felt like some newborn creature,
       opening its eyes in a familiar world that it had
       never known" (350).
    +Mediocre/Poor
      +"The foamy wavlets curled upto her white feet and
       coiled like serpents around her ankles" (Chopin
       350).
  +
[Block Quote]
+
  +If the quote is more that four typed lines, block
   quote format should be used
    +example
    +jack smith explains..:
        +cow tipping is dangerous.. (123)
    +therefore, ...
  +long quotations are introduced by an infromative
   sentence and usually followed by a colon (:)
  +indent 1"(inch)" from the margin(tab twice)
  +do not uuse quotation marks

--[Explanatory Synthesis]--
+
[Ch 4]
+
+What is a Synthesis
  +Written discussion that draws on 2 or more sources
    +must show relationships between sources
    +must understand what the sources say through
     summary
    +(Good idea to make a chart, and list major points)
    +
+Purpose
  +use the wording of your assignment to determine the
   purpose of your synthesis
  +select sources for your sythesis based on whether or
   not they help you in fulfilling your purpose
+Using your sources
  +purpose determines not only what parts of your
   sources you will use but also how you will relate
   them to one another
    +examples of relationships
    +->
      +cause and effect
      +comparison
      +contrast
    +<00
+Explanatory vs argument
  +2 kinds of syntheses are explanatory and argument
    +explanatory: main purpose is to convey
     information(inform)
    +argument: main purpose is to conveyy opinion or
     interpretation(persuade); arguments take specific
     positions or convey a point of view
  +explanatoryy intends to be unbiased
+
+Guidelines for writing synthesis
+_..
  +(pg 102..
  +consider purpose in writing
  +select and carefully read your sources, according to
   your purspose. mentally summarize each
  +take notes on your reading
  +formulate an explanatory thesis in the form of a
   complete sentence
  +decide how you will use your source material.
  +develop an organizational plan or outline
  +draft the topic sentence for the main section
  +draft
  +document your sources
  +revise your synthesis
+
+include an essay map
+authors viewpoints.. about 2 authors view points per
 body paragraph (double check this point..)
+topic sentence
+source a view, source b view, source c view
+
+topic
+source a view, source b view

thesis bold, underline topic sentences
--[Argumentative Synthesis]--
What is an argument synthesis?
  an arument is an attempt to persuade a reader or
   listener that a particular and debatable claim is
   true
  an argument synthesis draws upon evidence from a
   variety of sources  in an attempt to persuade others
   of the truth or validity of a depatable claim
Argument vs explanatory
  explanatory:
    emphasis on the sources themselves
    aim is to inform
  argument
    emphasis on the writer's use of the sources
    aim is to persuade
elements of the argument
  claim: what you are trying to prove
  support: how you prove it
  assumption: velief or principle about some aspect of
   the world and how it operates
  
Three appeals of argument
  logos: rational appeal, appeal to reason
    deductive reasoning: begins with a generalization
     and then moves to cite a specific case related to
     that generalization, which leads to a conclusion
    inductive reasoning: begins with several peices of
     specific evidence and then draws a conclusion from
     the evidence
  ethos: ethical appeal, appeal to the ethics of the
   person making the argument
  pathos: emotional appeal, appeal to the emotions of
   the audience, rarely used in academic writing
[Steps to writing]
  Consider your purpose
  Make a claim; formulate a thesis
  Decide how you will use source material
  Develop an organizational plan
  Formulate an argument strategy
  Draft and revise
(figure our argument first, then find source material)
  this will make writing the paper much much easier
Organizational strategy
  problem/solution
    begin  with an introduction in which you define the
     problem
    perhaps explain its origins
    offer solutions
    conclude
  two sides of a controversy
    introduce the controversy and (in an argument
     synthesis) your own point of view or claim
    explain the other side's arguments
    provide reasons why your point of view should
     provail
    conclude
  compare and contrast by source/subject
    introduce, lead to thesis
    summarize source a, discuss
    summarize source b, discuss
    compare and contrast source a and b
    conclude by summarizing your points and rased
     respond to questions
  compare and contrast by criteria
    
    introduce, lead to thesis
    criterion 1
      author 1
      author 2
    criterion 2
      author 1
