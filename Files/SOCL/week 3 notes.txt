      The Ability to do this is gradually attained
      First, they only take the role of "Significant 
       Others" (ie parents)
      As children develop they internalize the 
       expectations/perspectives of more people
         occupations
         fictional characters
      Eventually children develop an understanding 
       of the others as a whole group
      Generalized Other: Our perception of how 
       others think of us in general
         doing things based on what others will think
          of you, like even if no one sees it
         "conciousness"
         norms that can and cannot be breached
         how people will react to actions
      3 Stages
         1: Imitation
            children under 3
            not yet attained sense of self separate 
             from others
            not actually role taking
               ie: parents cursing around children, 
                and they learn to do so as well
         2: Play
            Ages 3 to 6
            Pretend to take the roles of specific people
            From parents, to fictional characters, to 
             community figures (Police, Firefighter, etc.)
            Frequent use of costumes
               using props
         3: Games
            After age 6 or 7
            Organized play, or games
            Child must be able to understand and 
             take multiple roles
               tag
               hide and seek 
               duck duck goose
      I and Me
         2 parts of the self: Me and I
         I: Self as the Subject
            Active, creative part of the self
            how we do things regardless of others
         Me: Self as object
            Attitudes we internalize from our 
             interactions with others
            what society tells you you are
            how has social location and experiences
             influenced the self
               I as Biology
               I as biography
               Me as history
         I is what makes you different
         The "I" is what evaluates social 
          interactions to construct the "Me"
         I is construction, Me is reaction

   Socialization into Gender
      Theories about learning gender
         Identification Theory
            Attributes gender differences in
              personality traits and behavior to
              biological differences between men and
              women
            Specifically attributes gender differences
              to children's awareness of differences in
              external genitals
