+Origins of Sociology
   +People have always asked questions about social life
   +Ancient peoples answered them with myths and
     superstition
   +Sociology is the application of science to these
     same questions
   +Seriously emerged in the middle of the 1800's

   +Grew out of social upheaval
   +Major social changes occured in during the end of
     the 1700's and the beginning of the 1800's

      +changes in work and family
      +loss of many traditional roles and interaction
        rituals

   +Founders
      +Auguste Comte (1798-1857)
         +What creates social order, instead of anarchy
           and chaos
         +First to propose the application of scientific
           method to the social world
         +Positivism
            +idea that human behavior is subject to
              causal laws like physics
         +called the new science "sociology"
         +greek: logos, study of
         +latin: socius, companion or being with others

         +Sociologist should discover knowledge about
           society, and should apply it to social reform
         +his form of science...
            +closer to being an Armchair Philosopher
	       +(Armchair as in observing society.)
         +drawing his conclusions from informal
           observations
         +his conclusions have been abandoned


         +because he coined the term "sociology" he is
           often credited with being the founder of
           science

         +Disagreed with Comte about the role of
           sociologists as reformers
         +No one should intervene with the evolution of
           society
         +Societies evolve from lower (barbarian) to
           higher (civilized)

         +The most capable members of society survive,
           while the less capable die out
         +Coined the phrase: Survival of the fittest
