line
line 2
this is the string to be underlined
             ^^^^^^                   
lets see if it worked
indent 1 worked
multiline test shall be a test to see if the string
  shall work for multiple lines and the textwrap function
                                              ^^^^^^                                                    ...
miserably failed
line 1 indent 2 test
   indent 2
   now see if the string will underline here
                   ^^^^^^                         
bullet point reduced to first indent, does not save
  indent.
further testing and editing may be required
underline indent 2 successful.
BUGS
   textwrap completely breaks it AND does not work
      places spaces before the bullet, I dont know how
        to fix this.. perhaps put the '\n' before the
        bullet to ensure that it is fixed.. or perhaps
        only after the string.
   indentation needs work
      if the bullet was indented, then the next line
        shall be reset to no indentation whatsoever.
      is that understandable in this case?
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                             see?
it just breaks it
