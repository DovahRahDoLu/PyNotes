--[Trigonometry]--
   for unit circle
      initial side is on the positive of the x axis
      Terminal side is the ending side

      counterclockwise is positive rotation
         theta angle
      Clockwise is negative rotation

      angles are determined from initial side to
        terminal side
      Coterminal Angles
         2 angles that start at the initial side end up
           in the same terminal side
         if negative rotation, angle is negative
   Arclength
      c=2(pi)r
      for the arclength of theta angle
         c = 2(pi)r * (theta/360)

   Radians
      radian is center angle of a unit circle
        corresponding to a unit arclength

      s = (pi/180) * theta
         if the angle 135 degrees
            135 * (pi/180)
            in radians, = 3pi/4
         if the angle 2pi/9 radians
            2pi/9 * 180/pi = 40 degrees


   Area
      areas of a sector
         ...
         formula sheet, understand the trig sheet on
           blackboard
